   "en": "His sure name is Suke and his given name is Banji, but he's known as Sukeban. Any town the Suke family has settled in just can't contain the violent nature of this family, forcing them to move time and time again. Because of his name, Banji ends up transferring to Amazon School as a female student! However, this situation coupled with Sukeban's rebellious nature undoubtedly will result in mayhem littered with maddening jokes and lewdity.\n\nThe manga has been adapted into two live-action films and an OVA."
