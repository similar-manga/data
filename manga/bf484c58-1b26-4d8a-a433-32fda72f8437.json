   "en": "1) Uzakoi  \nShuuji thinks that girlfriends become troublesome when they start saying annoying things… which is why he always breaks up with them in a few days. The only girl that last longer is Risa… but she is 'just' his 'lover'.  \n  \n2) Suki desu Oniichan  \nAoi loves her childhood friend, Koutarou-oniichan. However, he only sees her as a little sister. Aoi's like a child, both inside and out. When a rival appears, she attempts to surpass her in womanly charms.  \n  \n3) Double☆Booking  \nWhen the twin boys who competed for her during childhood return in high school, Misato still has trouble choosing between them.  \n  \n4) Anata no Kioku  \nNagisa has lost parts of her memory in an accident, or maybe she has chosen to pretend that she has forgotten some unpleasant memories.  \n  \n5) Sakura no Shita de Kiss wo Shite  \nMahiro is afraid that her relationship with sensei will end upon her graduation."
