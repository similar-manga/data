   "en": "Little Ghost Q-Taro, by Fujiko Fujio, is a Japanese manga about a ghost, Q-Taro who lives with the Ohara family. Q-Taro, also known as Q-chan or Oba-Q, is a mischief-maker who likes to fly around scaring people and stealing food, though he is deathly afraid of dogs.  \n  \nThe story is usually focused on the antics of Q-Taro and his friends. The manga was drawn in 1964–1966 by Fujiko Fujio (Fujiko F. Fujio and Fujiko Fujio A) and in 1971–1974 by only Fujiko F. Fujio. An English manga volume was published in Japan as Q the Spook."

Throughout their career they won many individual and collaborative awards, and are best known for creating the popular and long-running series Doraemon, the main character of which is officially recognized as a cultural icon of modern Japan.
