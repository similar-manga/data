   "en": "A collection of stories of joy and pain from falling in love!  \n  \n1) Natsu no Kakera  \nWada Naoto, a 2nd year in high school, is longing for a “summer lover”. Pretending to be a university student, he flirted around. Turned out that the beautiful girl he met was from his school… What supposed to be just a short, after-school fling, Naoto would call her to have sex with her. Sex is no longer enough with the desire to reduce the distance. His emotions surging up everytime he has sex with Mayu, Wada tried to act cool about it. As for Mayu, countless thoughts crossed her mind as she is unable to control her feelings for Wada. Can she finally express her true self to him?  \n  \n2) Hatsukoi♥Again  \n  \nThe former \"polka dot faced\" girl and the \"fatty\" meet in a goukon!? But wait, wasn't he a kind, and gentle before, now he may have changed on the inside as well…  \n  \n3) Yasashii Kizu  \nLike in a TV drama, she saw a handsome guy get dumped. In order to cheer him up, she invited him to her house, but she ended up getting drunk and ended up sleeping with him! Despite of their one night stand, they did become friends. Can they be more than friends?  \n  \n4) Anata o Hitorijime  \nShinoda Suzu has accidentally collides with the school's \"scariest\" person Kikuza Tsuyoshi. Instead of being rough, he ends up saving her instead from her clumsiness. Realising that all of those rumours are just a misunderstanding, Shinoda starts to fall for him…  \n  \n5) Anata o Hitorijime - Extra  \nA little snapshot of the clumsy Suzu and the \"scary\" Kikuza's date together, in his POV!"
