   "en": "\"Should we just go for it? Marriage?\"  \n\"…That's it!\"  \nLove that blossoms post marriage can be a thing too, right?  \n  \nNasukawa, a pragmatic graduate student in science, and Kaburagi, an elite office employee, are university colleagues and very good friends. They've been living together to save money, but are told by their landlord, that two male friends are prohibited from sharing a room, so the two get married as camouflage.  \n  \nNasukawa notices that ever since their marriage, his heart is throbbing for Kaburagi, who's supposed to be just his friend.  \n  \nMeanwhile, when Nasukawa's bed breaks and ends up sleeping with Kaburagi in his bed, Kaburagi makes a move. A mildly intense physical intimacy between two adults. When Nasukawa's body inadvertently reacts, and he's trying to calm himself down, Kaburagi suggests, \"practical mutual masterbation\" and…!?  \n  \nA heart throbbing and steamy story of a twisted newlyweds' life between a thoughtful elite office worker, and a kind and laid-back graduate student."
