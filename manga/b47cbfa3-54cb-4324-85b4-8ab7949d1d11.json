   "en": "A collection of Minami Maki's earlier oneshots, some dating back to the time the first chapter of SA was written:  \n  \n1) Happy Dining  \nChiyuki's dream is to cook and have Mori Futoshi, her favorite plump actor, eat her food. And that dream almost came true! She was disappointed to find out that Mr. Futoshi rarely eats at home. The only Futoshi who does eat at home is Tsubasa, the second son of the Futoshi family, who she meets after knocking on their door. What cute shenanigans await them?  \n  \n2) Half Potato  \nStudent Counsel VP may be nicknamed Chousuke because she's tough around boys, but deep down, she has no clue how to act around them. Except perhaps Student Counsel president Gouda, who is lousy at his job and constantly surrounded by girls. But he one day admitted he doesn't date anyone because he has a girl he likes and Chousuke can't stop thinking about it. The Harvest Festival is coming up, so why is he talking about celebrating *Confession* Festival with her instead of breaking the yam with the one he likes?!  \n  \n3) Lying Cinderella  \n  \n4) S-People  \n  \n5) Snow, Warmth!"
