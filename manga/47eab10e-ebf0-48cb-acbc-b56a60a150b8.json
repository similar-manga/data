   "en": "Honami is a mysterious man who lives alone in a townhouse while attending university and running his own company. Eight years younger than Honami, Kanna met him at a time when she was at the bottom of her life, having lost her job, boyfriend, house, and savings due to a series of unbelievable betrayals. She is offered to live with him at his house until she gets a job, and in return, she does his housework. But when she asks him why he helped her, he says that it was to repay her for what she did for him that day, even though they had never met before. Honami is a man of mystery who never talks much about himself, but he is always on Kanna's side, and her tensed feelings are loosened.... She can't get away from the pampered younger guy!\n\n(google translated)"
