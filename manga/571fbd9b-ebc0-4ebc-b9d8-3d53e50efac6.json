   "en": "(from ebookjapan): \n\nSasuke was born the son of a peasant farmer. Overcoming his parents' objections, he enrolled in the Koga School of Ninjutsu and trained in ninjutsu until the age of 15. His grades were poor and he flunked three times, was suspended from school eight times, received 56 write ups, and was reprimanded 162 times. \n\nEven Tozawa Hakunsai, a teacher who could not bear to see him fail, took away his ninjutsu license and had him sealed in the art of ninjutsu. At that time, Sasuke's village is attacked by an army and his parents are killed. Sasuke, using his ninjutsu as a weapon, burns with a desire for revenge.\n\n An early shojo manga \"Kodama-chan\" is also included.\n\n---\n**Volumes 215 and 216 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
