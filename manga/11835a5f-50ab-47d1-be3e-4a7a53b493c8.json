   "en": "A collection of short stories:  \n  \n1) Irabayashi-san no Phantom Arm  \nIrabayashi Fumi is a cute teenage girl and the ace of the school swimming team. One day, she unexpectedly joins the occult club. Isahaya learns her secret: she's trying desperately to rid herself of two invisible 'phantom arms.' Will he be able to help her?  \n  \n2) Sunaboshi / Galactic Desert  \nAfter the tragic, accidental death of his clubmate and crush, Hiori, Kyouta's astronomy club is abolished. One day, he wakes up to find that his broken binoculars have manifested a girl that looks just like Hiori…  \n  \n3) Okurimono  \nThe brief story of Sano, a boy who dreamed of being an artist, and his first love Abe Kanako, who dreamed of being a performer.  \n  \n4) Kotonoha  \nWhen Hana was little, she used to tell all the boys she liked them. One day, a demon appeared and cursed her, telling her that any boy she confessed to would die. After the next boy she claimed to like died in an accident, Hana became terrified of dooming any other boys to death. Six years later, she finds a boy she actually wants to date, but can she do so without bringing down the curse?  \n  \n5) Living Quarter  \nHumanity has split into two forms: the winged people who live in the sky, and the ordinary humans who still live on Earth. Kae, a normal human, has a grudge against the winged people for a tragic occurrence in the past. However, Kae's mother is winged. Kae must decide whether to allow herself to become a winged person or essentially lose her mother."
