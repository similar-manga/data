   "en": "\"I'd never met a teacher like him!\"  \n  \nHer breath stopped, and so did the air around her. She wanted to show him how she felt. Her heart was shaking. She'd never seen someone as beautiful as a painting before. She fell in love for the first time with her teacher. In an attempt at getting closer to him, she attended a goukon as an older student named \"Mika.\" They had a lot of fun but at the end of the night he told her that he would never go out with one of his students!  \n  \nEven so, she decided to meet him again as \"Mika.\" She wanted to be close to him more than anything, and she continued to lie to him."
