   "pt-br": "Cross Game de Mitsuru Adachi, conta sobre a história de Koh Kitamura e suas quatro vizinhas, as irmãs Tsukishima, especialmente Wakaba e Aoba. A familia de Koh possui uma loja de artigos esportivos e a família Tsukishima tem uma cafeteria com um centro de rebatidas. Wakaba (uma das irmãs Tsukishima) e Koh nasceram no mesmo dia e no mesmo hospital e são amigos desde pequeno. Wakaba trata Koh como o seu namorado, para o desdém de Aoba, que é bastante ciumenta devido sua adoração pela irmã mais velha, nutrindo assim um certo ódio de Koh. Mas quando ocorre uma reviravolta do destino, suas vidas são completamente mudadas, e assim Koh ganha um novo sonho: ir para o Koshien."
