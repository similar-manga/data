   "en": "A series of 5 'picture book' manga for very young children, Ishinomori crafts his own tales that fit right at home with well-known Japanese folklore, gracing them with dozens and dozens of gorgeously done two-page spreads.\n\n- **Child of the Stars** - Hikaru is a boy of mysterious parentage, said to have come down from the stars. One day, Hikaru comes to face an oni with his own reason for attacking Hikaru, one connected to Hikaru's past.\n- **The Dragon's Whiskers** - Taro's mother is ill, but legend has it that if she drinks a boiled dragon's whisker, her illness will be cured. Taro goes on his quest to obtain this whisker.\n- **Tale of the 1000 Year-Old Cedar** - A tengu father suddenly finds himself responsible for several human children. A yamauba offers to care for the children by becoming their mother, but he refuses. Frustrated, the yamauba is set on making him suffer...\n- **Aim For It! Saburota** - Saburota's father was killed by a whale ('the white monster'), and his mother dies from the shock. Now orphaned, Saburota aims to become a great harpooner to avenge his parent's deaths.\n- **Kon Kon Kon** - A young boy who doubts kitsune ends up crossing paths with one, as he suddenly ends up in different worlds, much to his confusion..."
