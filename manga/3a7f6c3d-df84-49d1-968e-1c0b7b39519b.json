   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\n\nSynopsis: Just before the end of the war, an aircraft carrier has become a floating but immobile castle. There are only two aircraft left. Pointing to one of them, Captain Shimada says, \"I'm going to board this one.\" The crew of the remaining plane had not been decided. To his comrades, who were reluctant to fly the plane, which was leaking oil badly, Flight Sergeant Tagawa said, \"I don't care as long as I can fly.\"\n\n Late at night, Shimada removes the sights from the plane, takes Tagawa with him, and buries the plane next to the propeller left behind by his fallen comrades. This is the grave where he buried his pride, and Shimada says to Tagawa, \"You have a duty to see that your pride is buried.\" \n\nThe next day, an enemy attack appears, and the two men go into battle. However, Tagawa's plane fails to fly satisfactorily due to a malfunction, and Shimada is left alone on the battlefield. \n\nFollowing \"The Cockpit\" and \"Case Hard\" this is the latest in the \"Cockpit\" series, the lifework of master mangaka Leiji Matsumoto."

Debuting in 1953 with a 16 page manga \"Mitsubachi no Bouken\" in Manga Shounen, he has authored nearly thirty manga series. His big break came in 1971, in the years between 53 and 71 he mostly produced Shoujo manga, much to his displeasure. In the late '70s and the early '80s, there was a big Matsumoto-boom when he drew his best known series. After that, things became more quiet around him, but the late '90s show a revival.\nIn 1997, Matsumoto began to create new adventures of Captain Harlock which can be admired on the Web in Japanese and in English.\n\nBorn on the same day as [ISHINOMORI Shotaro](https://mangadex.org/author/36f5f595-0196-4d0a-aae1-0f730679d10a/ishinomori-shotaro), and both of them at the same time were assistants under [TEZUKA Osamu](https://mangadex.org/author/21575d70-b954-4e3a-80df-00192f413a83/tezuka-osamu).\n\nHis real name is Matsumoto Akira. Reiji is a pseudonym and means something like \"Zero Warrior\". His name is often rendered in romaji as \"Matsumoto Leiji\". Matsumoto is married to [MAKI Miyako](https://mangadex.org/author/f0e514c6-3bd4-483a-89ce-79dbcb17045d/maki-miyako).\n\nLeiji Matsumoto, the son of an air force pilot, was only fifteen years old when his first story, ‘Mitsubachi no Bouken’, was published in Manga Shônen. Soon, he created a varying oeuvre, at first inspired by Tezuka, in several genres: children's comics (‘Kuroi Hanabira’, ‘S no Taiyou’, science fiction (Denkou Ozma, Sexaroid, Kousoku Esper), westerns and others. He was one of the first mangakas whose manga and animation work crossed over internationally.\n\nHis fame came with the series Otoko Oidon, about the student Nobotta Oyama, who was rejected by all universities. Matsumoto mostly enjoyed creating war stories, but he had his biggest success with science fiction stories such as Uchuu Senkan Yamato, a series that was created simultaneously for TV and comics. His space pirate Captain Harlock first appeared in Arcadia in 1977. Around the same time, he set up other science fiction series, including Ginga Tetsudou 999 and Sennen Joou. His 1974 Sci-Fi anime ‘Space Cruiser Yamato’ earned fame in the USA from 1979 under the title 'Star Blazers'. Matsumoto was hired by the French band Daft Punk to animate their music videos from the album ‘Discovery’, and compiled into the 2003 anime movie 'Interstella 5555'.\n\nAmong his assistants there were [SENNO Knife](https://mangadex.org/author/c33f02c8-174e-4005-9a49-4f3cd027cac8/senno-knife), [SHINTANI Kaoru](https://mangadex.org/author/87db03ea-8f14-4404-8cfd-47fc91229f6f/shintani-kaoru), and [AKANA Shuu](https://mangadex.org/author/a12c508a-3805-4971-86fe-1bc83efd2074/akana-shuu). \n\nSources:\n - [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/authors.html?id=2044)\n - [Anilist](https://anilist.co/staff/97597/Matsumoto-Leiji)\n - Ultimate Manga Guide"
