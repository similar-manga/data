   "en": "Even someone like me can ask, what about me? Kana is a full-time housewife, who can't get her husband to spend time with her. She is not good at socializing, and unlike in her hometown, she has no close friends nearby and feels lonely and isolated. She wants someone to talk to because should be able to do it... That's why she decided to use a matching app to make her friends. She initially had a wrong impression of the app, but the person who confirmed with her that it was just an app to exchange messages was a handsome college student, Misaki. Friendly and easy to talk to, and helped to ease her loneliness. She was glad to be able to make friends and speak to and for the first time in a long while she started to feel happy."
