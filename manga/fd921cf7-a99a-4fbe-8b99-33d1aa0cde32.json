   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nA toy shop in front of the main gate of Yoshiwara, a pleasure quarter in Edo, is very popular among children for the bamboo dragonflies sharpened by the store keeper, a man named \"Tonbo\". However, the main business of this store is a \"finder\" who collects debts in Yoshiwara. ...... The large, unreliable dragonfly solves various troublesome problems in Yoshiwara, including those related to sex, money, and the love between parents and children, with \"chic\" and skill! A masterpiece of humanistic jidaigeki that depicts the lives of ordinary people full of emotion and has been well-received since its serialization in \"Big Comic\" in 1975!"

In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category.
