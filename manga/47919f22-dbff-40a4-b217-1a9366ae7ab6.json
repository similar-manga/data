Knowing he'll never catch the super elite beauty, Kazama is content to watch from the sidelines. But then he accidentally witnesses an unprofessional side to Sudou. Does it mean Kazama has a chance, or is his case more hopeless than ever?  \n  \n3) Sweet Funny Fighter  \nKouna's not sure when he fell in love with Seto, but he can't stop visiting the convienence store clerk and trying to get a reaction out of the expressionless kid.
