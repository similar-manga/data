   "en": "Professional baseball team in Tokyo , Tokyo Taketsu Red Sox. In the past, it was known as a prestigious team that had talented players enrolled and competed for the championship in the pennant race every year. However, in the past few years, his grades have been sluggish, he has become a regular at the bottom, and his evaluation has plummeted. The players are lethargic, and even though the fans jeer at their negligent play, they are in a state where the wind blows.\n\nAround that time, Natsumon Asano , a young man who once made a name for himself as a young Red Sox ace, was living as a shark hunter in the United States after retiring due to an elbow injury. However, at one point, I witnessed Kihachi Shido , who was my teacher during the Red Sox days , being held responsible for the slump in the team he led as manager. In order to repay the kindness received from Shido, Asano decided to return to active duty and set foot in Japan again.\n\nThe famous players who fought together with the Red Sox in the golden age will gather again, and the whole team will gradually regain the appearance of the former \"fighting corps\". Asano has also overcome the blank and made a complete comeback as a strong pitcher, but a destined confrontation with \"Prince\" Okushige Misono , a genius player who is the fourth hitter of the Yomiuri Giants and is said to be the strongest player in Japan, awaits him. was"
