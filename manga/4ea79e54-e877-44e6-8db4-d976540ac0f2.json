   "en": "In this world, there are \"birthing men,\" or men who are engineered to be able to give birth. They look like women from the outside, though they are actually men. When ordinary guy Ujiie Kiyotaka left his Hokkaido island home to go to high school, he ended up in a dorm with three of these men: Kitadate Gaku, Sakenobe Masaomi and Shimura Shume. They're looking for wealthy brides in high school, and it turns out that Kiyotaka has also been tasked by his family to find a wife. After a landslide drives them out of their dorm, Kiyotaka and the three birthing men begin to live together as they start their bride-seeking adventures!"
