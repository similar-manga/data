   "en": "Burn Leo, burn! ! The blockbuster reprint series finally reaches its climax! Uchiyama Ultraman Vol. 4 = \"Leo\", who has a lot of enthusiastic fans, is now available in a double recording of the \"2nd grader\" and \"3rd grader\" editions with double the volume!! Ultraman, an immortal hero born in Japan. Mamoru Uchiyama's version of 'Ultraman', which was serialized very popularly by 'second graders' from 1971 to 1974, will be released as a full-scale book for the first time this autumn to commemorate the 45th anniversary of Tsuburaya Productions' Ultraman Series! The fourth installment is \"Ultraman Leo\" (1974)! Leo who transforms Ootori Gen, his younger brother Astra, and Ultra Seven = Moroboshi Dan who trains Gen will save the earth! Leo and the others defeat astonishing enemies one after another, such as the legendary \"Tsuruku Rider Corps\". Please enjoy Uchiyama's ultra world with clear writing! \u003cbr\u003eThe smart and elegant character design, speedy development, and dynamic battle scenes are truly unique to Mamoru Uchiyama. On that day, Leo's success that the boys were heartbroken... is coming back after 37 years! The series, which was praised as \"one of the masterpieces\" among the many Ultraman comics, was only released as a convenience store comic in the mid-2000s after being published in a magazine (already sold out), and is now difficult to obtain. It became a rare work of \"phantom\", and it was eagerly desired to be published in a cohesive form. Director Shinji Higuchi is also enthusiastic! (=Recommendation comments below) A chance to have four popular masterpieces in our own “reprint request” in an affordable form. Includes the full story of the monthly magazine serialization, including all the cover art from the magazine serialization, a new interview with Mamoru Uchiyama full of creative secrets, and a mini comic \"Time Slip Graffiti My Ultra 1974\" drawn by Mamoru Uchiyama. Stay tuned! !
