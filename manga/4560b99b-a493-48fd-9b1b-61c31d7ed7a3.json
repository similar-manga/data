   "en": "Hanamoto Mika is a shy, self-conscious 17-year-old-girl who wants very much to love and be loved. Hopelessly superstitious and unhappy with her current self, Mika tries to find answers and guidance to her life through fortune-telling and romance magazines. She decides to go on a group date with her friends and meets Takada. It’s love at first sight; at least on her end. Soon after, she encounters Takada coincidentally on the subway, but Mika trips and falls at his feet, then runs away in mortification before he could say a word. They meet again on a second group date, but to Mika’s humiliation, he has no recollection of her from the first date! But he does remember her embarrassing moment on the train. He apologizes for not remembering her and then explains that he had lost his contacts and couldn’t see clearly on that first date. Emboldened by his confession, she shocks him and herself by asking him out on a date! This is the story of unlikely relationships, and the trials and tribulations that await Mika and Takada - and their friends- in their search for love."
