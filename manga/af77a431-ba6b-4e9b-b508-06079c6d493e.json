The Beni family, descendants of the former lord of the castle, still has a storehouse and a large ginkgo tree as remnants of their former life.\n\nEventually, her grandfather passed away, leaving behind a mysterious will. It said that there was a wonderful legacy by the ginkgo tree. \n\nIn addition to \"Wonderful Legacy,\" which depicts the turmoil that comes to Nene after her grandfather's death, this collection includes \"Going In, Erica Style\" and \"Erica Red Whirlwind."
