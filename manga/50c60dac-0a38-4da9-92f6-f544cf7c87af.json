Debuting in 1953 with a 16 page manga \"Mitsubachi no Bouken\" in Manga Shounen, he has authored nearly thirty manga series. His big break came in 1971, in the years between 53 and 71 he mostly produced Shoujo manga, much to his displeasure. In the late '70s and the early '80s, there was a big Matsumoto-boom when he drew his best known series. After that, things became more quiet around him, but the late '90s show a revival.\nIn 1997, Matsumoto began to create new adventures of Captain Harlock which can be admired on the Web in Japanese and in English.\n\nBorn on the same day as [ISHINOMORI Shotaro](https://mangadex.org/author/36f5f595-0196-4d0a-aae1-0f730679d10a/ishinomori-shotaro), and both of them at the same time were assistants under [TEZUKA Osamu](https://mangadex.org/author/21575d70-b954-4e3a-80df-00192f413a83/tezuka-osamu).\n\nHis real name is Matsumoto Akira. Reiji is a pseudonym and means something like \"Zero Warrior\". His name is often rendered in romaji as \"Matsumoto Leiji\". Matsumoto is married to [MAKI Miyako](https://mangadex.org/author/f0e514c6-3bd4-483a-89ce-79dbcb17045d/maki-miyako).\n\nLeiji Matsumoto, the son of an air force pilot, was only fifteen years old when his first story, ‘Mitsubachi no Bouken’, was published in Manga Shônen. Soon, he created a varying oeuvre, at first inspired by Tezuka, in several genres: children's comics (‘Kuroi Hanabira’, ‘S no Taiyou’, science fiction (Denkou Ozma, Sexaroid, Kousoku Esper), westerns and others. He was one of the first mangakas whose manga and animation work crossed over internationally.\n\nHis fame came with the series Otoko Oidon, about the student Nobotta Oyama, who was rejected by all universities. Matsumoto mostly enjoyed creating war stories, but he had his biggest success with science fiction stories such as Uchuu Senkan Yamato, a series that was created simultaneously for TV and comics. His space pirate Captain Harlock first appeared in Arcadia in 1977. Around the same time, he set up other science fiction series, including Ginga Tetsudou 999 and Sennen Joou. His 1974 Sci-Fi anime ‘Space Cruiser Yamato’ earned fame in the USA from 1979 under the title 'Star Blazers'. Matsumoto was hired by the French band Daft Punk to animate their music videos from the album ‘Discovery’, and compiled into the 2003 anime movie 'Interstella 5555'.\n\nAmong his assistants there were [SENNO Knife](https://mangadex.org/author/c33f02c8-174e-4005-9a49-4f3cd027cac8/senno-knife), [SHINTANI Kaoru](https://mangadex.org/author/87db03ea-8f14-4404-8cfd-47fc91229f6f/shintani-kaoru), and [AKANA Shuu](https://mangadex.org/author/a12c508a-3805-4971-86fe-1bc83efd2074/akana-shuu). \n\nSources:\n - [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/authors.html?id=2044)\n - [Anilist](https://anilist.co/staff/97597/Matsumoto-Leiji)\n - Ultimate Manga Guide"
