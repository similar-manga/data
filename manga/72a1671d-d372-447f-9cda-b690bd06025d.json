   "en": "On December 22nd, 1954, a large crowd of more than 15,000 gathered at the Kuramae Kokugikan in Tokyo in the cold weather! (quoted in text). Rikidozan, the hero who brought pro wrestling boom to Japan, and Kimura who reigned over the throne of the Japanese judo world at that time. Friends who once formed a tag team to drive out the strong Sharp brothers were facing a duel match.\nKimura, who is the top of the judo world, does not want to end up as a foil for Rikidozan. It ends with Kimura's miserable appearance.\nSuddenly, a loud voice from the audience echoed in the hall, asking Rikidozan for a match.\nIt was the young Masutatsu Oyama himself. Oyama, who was Kimura's junior at Takuma University, could not stand the appearance of his senior who suffered a crushing defeat, and raised his voice to Rikidozan. On the spot, Ikki Kajiwara, still a high school student, was stunned by the sight of the three great monsters of martial arts.\nFrom here, the history of Japanese martial arts began, and the graphic novel life of writer Ikki Kajiwara also started.\nHow did Ikki Kajiwara become a one-of-a-kind graphic novelist?\nThe culmination of Kajiwara's comics, which is the posthumous work of the giant star Ikki Kajiwara and is also his autobiography.\nMany martial artists and celebrities appear in the story with their real names, a shocking non-fiction entertainment work."
