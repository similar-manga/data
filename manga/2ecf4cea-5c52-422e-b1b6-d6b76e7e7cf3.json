   "en": "\"Someday I'll definitely return... In the palm of your hand...\"\n\"Small Giant Microman\" \u0026 \"Microman Red Powers\" celebrating their 25th anniversary!\nReissued with a large volume of about 780 pages in total, including about 200 pages that have not been recorded.\n\nIn 1974, Takara (currently Takara Tomy) sent out a masterpiece SF toy series \"Microman\" . Even after the first development in 1980, it is a popular series that has been revived many times in response to its popularity.\nIn many of the product series that have been released intermittently like this, media development centered on comicalization has also been carried out. Among them, \"Small Giant Microman\", which is based on the toy series \"Microman Magne Powers\" developed in 1998, is the only animation work and boasts high name recognition. And based on the anime of the same name, the manga written by Hisashi Matsumoto is this work \"Small Giant Microman\".\n\nAlthough positioned as a \"comicalized\", this work, which began serialization in Kodansha's \"Comic Bonbon\" in 1997 in advance of the anime, has attracted a wide range of readers due to its attractive character modeling, unique story development, and sophisticated drawings. It gained popularity and continues to be highly rated to this day.\nHowever, while \"Small Giant Microman\", which was serialized in \"Comic Bonbon\" from the October 1998 issue to the December 1999 issue, was made into a book in all three volumes, the direct sequel \"Microman\" was serialized subsequently. Red Powers” ​​(serialized in the February 2000 issue to the July 2000 issue of Comic Bonbon) was not published in book form, and the only way to get a sense of the story was by looking at the actual magazine.\n\nTherefore, this time, with the cooperation of Professor Hisashi Matsumoto and related companies, we will publish \"Small Giant Microman\" and \"Microman Red Powers\" in a newly edited two-volume book.\nFor this publication, we have collected and scanned all the existing books and published magazines. The scanned images have been digitally restored, and the image quality has been updated to withstand republication.\n\nA5 version, this book will be sent in a large volume of about 780 pages in total for the first and second volumes. Please take it in your hand and check the ending of the story.\n\n★ Features of this book\n1. The first book that covers the manga works \"Small Giant Microman\" and \"Microman Red Powers\".\n2. A large volume of about 780 pages in total for the first and second volumes.\n3. The image quality has been greatly updated from the existing book by digital restoration."
