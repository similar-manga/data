   "en": "Hyung Gee is an ordinary high student, but is unaware of the power he holds called Shade. His encounter with Soy completely changes his life around, as the hidden powers within him awakens, causing Soy and her Shade to lose their lives. Unaware of the mystery behind Shade and the role of a Shade Magician, Hyung Gee decides to join School, which is an organization that does research on Shade Magicians. Although Hyung Gee joined to find out more about his powers and his parents (who are currently missing), little does he know that this was all a plot from the School to get him to join."
