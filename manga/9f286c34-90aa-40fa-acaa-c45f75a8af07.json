     "en": "Hiro Mashima (真島 ヒロ, Mashima Hiro, born May 3, 1977) is a Japanese manga artist. He gained success with his first serial Rave Master, published in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine from 1999 to 2005. His best-selling work, Fairy Tail, published in the same magazine from 2006 to 2017, became one of the best-selling manga series with over 72 million copies in print. Mashima began the currently ongoing Edens Zero in 2018.\n\nMashima-Sensei is known for many things, but his big three tend to be an art style heavily reminiscent of One Piece, a love for the power of friendship, and a strong work ethic - at one point, he wrote six chapters of Fairy Tail in two weeks, and even now simultaneously balances drawing Edens Zero, doing storyboards for Fairy Tail spin-offs, and playing video games in his spare time.
