Yuko has grown up to be a pretty nurse, and Naosuke begins to have an affair with her. With the new bigamy laws, Naosuke wants to marry Yuko, too. But how badly would that hurt his first wife? And how will he deal with it if Yuko also finds another man to marry? Naosuke and the people around him are starting to shift towards the new and approved 'double marriage' lifestyle, but they may not be ready for the complicated problems that can arise…"
