   "en": "**This is a manga adaptation of the first Detective Conan movie.**\n\nConan Edogawa is facing a dilemma: Ran Mouri has asked Shinichi Kudou out to the movies, and he is unable to provide a convincing excuse not to go. However, when the day of the date arrives, he has more pressing problems to worry about — a great amount of plastic explosives has recently been stolen and the culprit has challenged Shinichi to find and dispose of the bombs he has scattered across the city. Now forced in a race against time, Conan must not only protect the city, but also figure out who the mastermind is and his reason for confronting Shinichi."
