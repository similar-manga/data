In an interview, Kubo has stated that he entered a magazine's manga contest, and that although he did not win, one of the magazine's editors noticed his talent. They subsequently worked together on joint projects. Not long afterward, his first manga short, \"Ultra Unholy Hearted Machine\", was published in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump Special in 1996. This was followed by two more shorts, and in 1999 his first serial, Zombie Powder, began in Weekly Shonen Jump and ran for four volumes until 2000.\n\nHis next serial, Bleach, about a high school student who becomes a shinigami and fights evil spirits, Kubo submitted a manuscript of Bleach to Weekly Shonen Jump shortly after Zombie Powder ended hoping that it would be published; the story was rejected, since the editors claimed it was too similar to Togashi Yoshihiro’s YuYu Hakusho. Toriyama Akira, the creator of Dragon Ball, saw the story and sent a letter of encouragement to Kubo which inspired him to continue working on Bleach. The serialization began running in the same magazine in 2001, and an anime adaptation began running in Japan in 2004. The manga was named a winner of the Shogakukan Manga Award for its category in 2005."
