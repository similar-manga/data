   "en": "A series of Shinjo Mayu anthologies.  \n  \nMayu-tan no Tokimeki Note #1 - Taboo ni Daite:  \n||  \n1) Embrace Me in TABOO (TABOO ni Daite Asou)  \nYayoi is a high school freshman. Her parents died when she was very little, and so now she lives with her older brothers Naoki, whom she goes to school with, and Tomoya, a medical student. One day, she learns that Naoki and she aren't really related by blood. Then Yayoi is overcome by the uncontrollable feeling that she loves him…!?  \n  \n2) Held up by You (Kimi ni Hold Up)  \nMiddle-school student Risa is accidentally arrested for prostitution! However, her real problem is that she's fallen for Detective Arikawa, but can a much older man fall for a girl, barely a child?  \n  \n3) City Romance (Shiti Romansu)  \nYouko just won a trip to the luxurious Century Hotel - but it's a trip for two. Without a boyfriend, who is she going to go with? That's where random bystander Tatsuya comes in!  \n  \n4) Blue Eyed Dandy (Aoi Hitomi no Dandii)  \nBorn from American parents, raised by a Japanese family, Yamato struggles with his two identities. Enter Serika, a typical Japanese girl who finds herself drawn to him. But can she help him reconcile his identity and move on with his life - with her?  \n||  \n  \nMayu-tan no Tokimeki Note #2 - Fiancée Shitai:  \n||  \n1) I Want to Be a Fiancée (Fiancée Shitai). (There are 5 chapters to this story). Yukimi is a high school junior and cheerleader already scheduled for her first marriage interview. She's seen a disappointing picture of her nerdy potential groom - and he has such a weird name - so Yukimi has every intention of rejecting him, but she's still curious to go and see what a marriage interview is like. Later that day, Yukimi meets her ideal man at a football match and inadvertantly begins cheering only for him – despite the fact that he's the opposing team's quarterback! He gives her a bold and seductive response. Ah, if only Yukimi's marriage interview could be with a guy like this… But why won't the sexy quarterback tell Yukimi his name…?  \n  \n2) My Darling in the Infirmary Room (Hoken Shitsu no My Darling)  \nMaki doesn't mind a few cuts and bruises if it'll earn her a ticket to the campus infirmary room. That's because her school's doctor is handsome Takashiro, age 23, single. She works so hard to make passes at him - and Takashiro knows it. But is Maki really so busy trying to catch his attention that she doesn't notice…?  \n||  \n  \nMayu-tan no Tokimeki Note #3 - Kokoro wo Hadaka ni Shite:  \n||  \n1) Bare the Heart (Kokoro wo Hadakani Shite)  \nMina is a high school freshman with a crush on her math teacher…who also happens to be her cousin Yukiya! Mina has always been very precious to Yukiya, and at times it seems like he can see straight through to her heart, but can he ever see her as a woman and not just his cute little cousin? How long can Mina's flirtations go unnoticed by Yukiya (or by the sadistic and lascivious chemistry teacher, for that matter)?  \n  \n2) A Vampire at My Neck (Kubisuji ni Banpaia)  \nBe careful when you go groping in the dark… you might just find a vampire! That's what happens to Hitomi. Now she's attracted to Kairi despite what he is. Or is it because of what he is? Kairi has a powerful charm… but is he too charming? Dangerously charming?  \n  \n3) Hold Me, Melt Me (Dakishimete Tokashite)  \nRyou is a high school sprinter who's racing for a different kind of goal–his pretty track manager, Airi! He says he wants chocolate from her on Valentine's Day, but…is that a delicious metaphor for something sweeter? Whatever the case, it melts in the mouth!  \n  \n4) Examine Me Gently (Yasashiku Mitene)  \nSanae just had her appendix removed. But while she waits in post-op for her surgery wound to heal, she starts to develop another malady–love sickness! And her handsome new attending physician, Dr. Touya, is the cause! What can cure Sanae's ailment? …A sponge bath, maybe?  \n  \nOmake: If you have ever wondered why Shinjo Mayu's female characters have such big breasts and why her heroines seem so young…then you must read this omake! It is a great insight into the mind of Shinjo Mayu!  \n||"
