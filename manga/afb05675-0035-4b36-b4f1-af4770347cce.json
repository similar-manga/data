   "en": "One night, on his way home, Kuranosuke encountered his childhood friend, Kazushi Natsui, who asked him: \"Would you become a mother of a little boy?\"  \n  \nKuranosuke realized, through his ​​insecurity, that the past was no longer buried and distant as he had thought. The fact that Kazushi, his first love, got married and had a child was something that he could have never imagined. Kuranosuke did not consider the possibility of forming a family at that time, but to help the smart Wakaba, he eventually accepted Kazushi into his life again. However, Kuranosuke couldn't imagine that he meant much more to Kazushi than just as a mother to Wakaba."
