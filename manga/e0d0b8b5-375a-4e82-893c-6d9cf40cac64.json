   "en": "A collection of oneshots.  \n  \n1. Faithless Lover  \nKeita, a very popular high-schooler, couldn’t understand the reason he always get dumped in his relationships. However on the night his friend, Shuuji, returned to town, his virginity was taken away by him. After weekly smooching with Shuuji, Keita soon realised he was in love with him and confessed. Shuuji rejected him immediately. Why did Shuuji reject him even though they have feelings for each other?  \n  \n2. Finger Tips Reaching Out  \nHideaki, the perfect, charismatic (and totally narcissistic) student council president of Tozawa High, is constantly annoyed by Sugimoto from class 3E. Sugimoto, on the other hand, pays zero attention to the President which only serves to annoy him even more.  \n  \n3. Everything's Too Late  \nKashiwai is bar-hopping with his colleagues when he is confessed to by a homo. Drunk, he accepts… but the next morning he can't remember anything. He wakes up with a naked stranger?!  \n  \n4. Proof of Love  \nKawamiya is head over heels about Suzuno. They're happily going out and very much in love - at least Kawamiya is… but who is \"Haru\"?  \n  \n5. Omake Extra ~The Boyfriends' Room~"
