Akasegawa was also associated with the avant-garde.\n\nIn January 1963, Akasegawa sent out invitations to a solo exhibition in the form of 1,000 yen notes with information regarding the exhibit on their backs. The following year, he was indicted for creating imitations of banknotes stemming from the 1894 Law Controlling the Imitation of Currency and Securities and was eventually convicted and given a 3 months suspended sentence for what was dubbed the \"Thousand-Yen Bill Incident.\"\n\nHis satirical manga, Sakura Illustrated, was originally published in the Asahi Journal (a weekly news magazine). Editorial disputes over its content led to a recall of one issue of the magazine, and led to a complete reorganization of its editorial board, cancelling publication the magazine for the following two weeks.\n\nHe writes humorous essays and other literary works under the pen name Otsuji Katsuhiko.\n\nPassed away on October 26, 2014.
