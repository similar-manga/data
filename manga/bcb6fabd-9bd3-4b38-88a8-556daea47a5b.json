   "en": "Nagai's ecchi parody of Superman, more so the 1978 film starring Christopher Reeve.\n\nFrom the planet Peetan (Century egg) in the Zha Cai (pickled mustard plant) Nebula, tens of billions of years away from Earth, comes the amazing Superman, Chou Man! He usually works part-time at a ramen shop, but his powers are stronger than any superhero, he can even leap over the Tokyo Tower in a single bound! To protect only justice, truth, and beautiful women, Cho-Man fights day and night, without regard for the troubles he causes around him!"

     "en": "Thanks to the success of Harenchi Gakuen, Dynamic Productions (ダイナミックプロダクション, also known as Dynamic Production or Dynamic Pro, ダイナミックプロ), was founded by Go Nagai with his brothers in April 1969. Meant to be a group to help him with his works, as a consequence Harenchi Gakuen, where he derived almost no royalties from the TV series, films, or related merchandise, Dynamic Productions became a company established to manage Nagai's relations and contractual rights of his work. Dynamic became one of the first companies to require publishers sign contracts (even today many manga are created and published only on the basis of verbal agreements).\n\n(Source: Wiki)"
