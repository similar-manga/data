   "en": "Hayama Honoka, a freshman at Asaka High School, is an easygoing, unmotivated teenage girl that seems to be unaware that she is more interested in girls than boys. Tomori, her best friend since middle school who is a little violent at times, reminds her that she must pick a club to join at school. Soon after, during the lunch break, Honoka sees a girl wandering the old, abandoned campus building and meets a shy and clumsy girl named Mizusawa Yuzuki who finds fascination in the building that is several decades old although, Honoka only sees it as dirty.  \n  \nHonoka and Yuzuki learn about a small school club called the Abandoned Building club. They meet the vice president of the club, Tachibana Mana, a very passionate and nicely-figured girl, and the two girls decide to join. The clubs purpose is to visit abandoned buildings, rooms or stations and see the beauty of the place that has been forgotten but which is full of history, places that are worn out by time, forgotten by people but filled with hints into the past."
