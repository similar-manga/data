   "en": "Take one Ronin, an academic failure, and drop him into a dormitory where 5 women reside. Add a little clumsiness and what do you get? Humpty Dumpty? The Three Stooges? Well…sort of. Keitaro Urashima is a dunce. He's been trying forever to get into Tokyo U with little success and what's worse, his parents kick him out the door. When turning to his grandmother Hinata for help, he stumbles upon a group of crazy women whose worlds he turns upside-down. And maybe he does get a little love in the end, if the giant onions and earthenware don't kill him first. Of course…that's after the ladies are through with him. This is a humorous tale of a guy surrounded by women who strives to make into college while being kicked in the face with a lot of hard-knock love on the way."

In his teenage years, Akamatsu failed the entrance exam to Tokyo University, and applied for Film Study instead (it is speculated that this is where he got the idea for Love Hina). Eventually, he became famous as an illustrator featured in Comiket (short for Comic Market, a comic convention bi-annually held in Japan). He used the pen name Awa Mizuno (水野 亜和, MIZUNO Awa). Akamatsu, still in college, then proceeded to win the Weekly Shonen Magazine award twice. His \"A Kid's Game for One Summer\" was awarded the coveted 50th Shonen Magazine Newcomer's Award soon after he graduated. After a big hit with A.I. Love You, he finally made a grand success with his new manga, Love Hina. The series appeared in Weekly Shonen Magazine and has been collected in eleven volumes (with fourteen volumes in total), which have sold over 6 million copies in Japan, and received the Kodansha Manga Award for shōnen in 2001.
