   "en": "The Gundam event report manga collection \"Matsudo Angler Corps\" has been made into a book for the first time! The Matsudo Bandai Museum in front of Matsudo Station in Matsudo City, Chiba Prefecture in 2004! Starting with a report on \"Mobile Suit Gundam MS Igloo\", which was shown only at the theater B-one on the first basement floor, we rushed to report on all kinds of Gundam events, Gundam goods, Gunpla, and Gundam games, and turned it into a report manga. Yasuyuki Tokumitsu's work was irregularly serialized in Monthly Gundam A under the title \"Soreike! Matsudo Angler Team\"! There were many voices that wanted to make it into a book, but for some reason the paper version was never published, and now it has been made into a book for the first time as an e-book!"
