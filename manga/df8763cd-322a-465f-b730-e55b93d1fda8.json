She believes her ribs look strange, and hears that she can have plastic surgery to alter the appearance of her ribcage. Yuki goes to a nearby clinic that performs the procedure, but is told that she must pass a mental health assessment before she can have the surgery."

Ito's work has developed a substantial cult following, with some deeming him a significant figure in recent horror iconography.\n\nIn 2006, Junji married Ayako Ishiguro (石黒亜矢子), a picture book artist. As of 2013, they have two children."
