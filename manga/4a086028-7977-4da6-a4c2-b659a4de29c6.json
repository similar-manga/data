   "en": "Both of them are straightforward people. Once they meet, they quickly get to know each other better. A heartwarming romantic comedy that begins with a certain incident. Shibata Kasane, a graphics designer at a toy design and development company, is troubled. Her troubles started when she grabbed her colleague Enokida Subaru's ass by accident! Kasane was intrigued by how similar Enokida's ass and her favourite childhood character felt. At the same time, Kasane felt guilty because Enokida might have been uncomfortable. Enokida said \"I don't mind\" but had a pained and frightened expression. Kasane was overcome by the urge to apologise profusely! On the other hand, it looks like Enokida is hiding something."
