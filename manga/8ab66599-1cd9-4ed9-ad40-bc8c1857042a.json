   "en": "Compilation of oneshots:  \n  \n1. If You Leave Me  \nAt a class reunion, Hazuki was reunited with his classmate, Watari with whom he used to have a relationship. Seeing Watari after so long, his slenderness and gentle expression hardly changed since then. For a moment, Hazuki was thrown back into his memories. Those hot summer days that lead to the unstoppable urge to feelâ€¦ Now that it came to mind, love was what it was. Will a reunion after 5 years apart reignite again the passion that was once there?  \n(- Blissful Sin)  \n  \n2. Trouble. Terrible. Dog  \nHiroya has a new roommate - super hyper freshman Suzushiro who always jumps on Hiroya like a puppy. Lately, however, Suzushiro has been acting super serious, and Hiroya is getting lonely… what could be the problem, and can Hiroya fix it?  \n  \n3. Love or Hate  \nProsecutor Kazuki and attorney Yuuichi have been together for five years, but that doesn't stop them from fighting about everything. (No, seriously: these dudes need marriage counseling…)  \n  \n4. White-robed King  \nKitahara is a new transfer student, but on his very first day he falls down the stairs and gets a sprain. The reason? A beautiful infirmary teacher in a white coat… but what is the teacher doing to him?! Oh, and it turns out, that teacher isn't exactly a teacher.  \n  \n5. Child's Talking Time  \nWhen you have a carefree life, you don't expect to fall in love, that's what Nagasa-sensei always thought. Little does he know that his love comes in the form of a man who is his colleague…  \n  \n6. Rival!  \nShort story about a sensei, his student, and his student's cat.  \n  \n7. Weekend Lovers  \nExtra for chapter 1."
