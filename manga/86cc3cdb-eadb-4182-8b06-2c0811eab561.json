   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nThe cradle swayed noisily even though there was no wind. When you peek into the basket, you see a cute baby wrapped in baby clothes smiling innocently. You are still clueless as your face relaxes in sympathy. You are still unaware of the wretched demon that resides in her soft, little body! It was at a general hospital that the body of Mr. J. Smith's baby was found a month after his death. Something was born out of the corpse a month after its death. Soon after, an unprecedented incident occurs in the neonatal room. When the nurses took their eyes off the baby, all the babies in the neonatal room disappeared. Only one baby remained, Mr. Smith's baby. The baby, named Priscilla, returns home with her parents, but all sorts of ominous things begin to happen to the Smith family. Why in the world-?　\n\nThe title story, \"Black Angel Sincera,\" is the first in a polished series after \"Mr. J. Smith's Baby.\"  While all the babies in the newborn room have died, only one baby, Sincera, is released from the hospital alive and well. With her cute sleeping face, her parents believe that she is an angel who brings happiness to everyone. However, the family was facing a series of ominous incidents and accidents. Then, the father, Paul, discovers the true nature of his beloved daughter, Sincera. What will the wheels of fate that have begun to turn so noisily lead the family to the end? Also included are two other stories from the \"Black Angel: Sincera\" series, \"The Ballad of Love and Death\" and \"The Red Pavilion.\" You will be taken in by the author's intention to draw you into the screen like a scene from a beautiful gothic horror movie, and while you shudder at the sight of the writhing demons, you will never be able to turn back!"
