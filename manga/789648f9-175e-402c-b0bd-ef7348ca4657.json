   "en": "A sweet volleyball romance! Ayumu is a gay high school student whose motto is, \"I like cute and pretty boys.\" (He himself is cute and pretty, after all!) But despite such a flippant motto, he is actually a rather serious type who is madly crushing on his friend from junior high, Saki. Saki is on the school's volleyball team and is gentle and soft-spoken - the very image of Ayumu's ideal \"type\". But what happens when, instead of catching Saki's attention, he catches the interest of the lazy, chain-smoking volleyball coach? The coach's name is Kouga-sensei, and he's a weirdo who has no manners at all. This bastard sensei confronts Ayumu with a rude question - \"You like boys, right?\" - and then bullies Ayumu into joining the volleyball team. But what are his true motives for bullying Ayumu? He's tall, dark, devious and unpleasant - far from Ayumu's \"cute and pretty\" ideal. Why, then, does he make Ayumu's heart race?"
