   "en": "Hino Akiharu lost his parents when he was an elementary student and was taken in by his uncle's family. One day, he sees on the news about the newly-established Hakureiryou Gakuin, a school which was re-built from an elite girls' school. He decides to take the exam for that school and succeeds in entering the House Management Department (the place to train maids \u0026 butlers). He wants to become a butler, although his appearance scares the ladies. Akiharu has a sinister look in his eyes, a scar on his right eyebrow, and bristled up hair. Add 3 piercings on his ears and he indeed has a typical bad boy look on him.  \n  \nHe meets his \"nemesis\" at that school, Saikyou Tomomi, a girl with a two faced character who traumatized him many times since they were kids. Another girl named Cernia Iori FlameHeart chases after him because of his looks and calls him suspicious. Still, Akiharu starts finding his feet at the school and his relationships with the girls also get better…"
