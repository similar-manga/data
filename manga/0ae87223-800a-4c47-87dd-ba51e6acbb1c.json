While she was walking on the streets late at night because she had to work late, she suddenly started wishing that she had a boyfriend. And a devil appeared in front of her eyes!? The guy who jumped in front of her on his skateboard looked like he had black wings…! He had jet black pupils and hair with a handsome face. And without notice he suddenly kissed her…!?  \n  \n2. Kamisama ni wa Naisho  \nMy boyfriend is the \"Angel-kun\" at school who is a pastor's son. However, I've been keeping a very big secret from him: I'm a temple girl! No matter what it takes, I must not reveal that!  \n  \n3. Sakura ga Furu Koro  \nHis loved one died, and with resolve, he yet again closes his heart.

I just want to find my black-hair lover, but he keeps getting in the way!  \n  \n5.
