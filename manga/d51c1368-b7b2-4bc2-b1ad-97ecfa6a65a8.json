   "en": "1: Akuma no Sasayaki  \nA Father found a young man named Raoul outside his church… Although he has horns and a tail, Raoul insists that he isn't a demon… In the end, through Raoul's plight, the Father allowed him food and a place to stay… However, can a demon and a priest find love?  \n  \n2: Akuma no Himitsu  \nA continuation of the romance between Raoul and the Father. After a long search, Raoul's brother finally locates him and ultimately answers the question: What exactly is Raoul?  \n  \n3: Muda na Koto Shimasho!  \nShuuji is a guy who hates to do unproductive things. He definitely doesn't get homosexuality, because in his mind, procreation is the purpose of sex. When he is hit on by a boy on the street, he punches him. Unfortunately for Shuuji, the boy, Sawatari, is a student at the school where Shuuji is starting his student teaching the next day. The practical, serious Shuuji may have well have met his match in the playful, flirtatious Sawatari.  \n  \n4: Yuki ga Kuru Mae ni  \n\"If I were a girl, I would fall head over heels for you…\" used to say Tomono jokingly to his buddy Yuba – until he found out that Yuba did not particularly mind that Tomono is not a girl…  \n  \n5: Akumatachi no Himitsu  \nContinuation of Akuma no Himitsu and Akuma no Sasayaki, this time focusing on Baldur, Raoul's older demon brother, and another incubi, Zahan."
