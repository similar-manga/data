   "en": "Begging for Prince Tariq Shadad ibn Zachir's mercy is the last thing Faye wants to do. She hasn't seen Tariq for a whole year…since their ill-fated wedding. But as Faye's brother remains imprisoned in her husband's country of Jumar, she learns that only Tariq has the power to grant his freedom.  \n  \nFaye expects her meeting with the man she married to be difficult, but Tariq's ultimatum takes her breath away: become his mistress and her brother will be released. As her decision takes her to the Middle East, her bitter feelings for Tariq begin to change, and she becomes more than just a mistress to this powerful Sheikh."
