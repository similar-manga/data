   "en": "The popular segment of Nogizaka46's All Night Nippon has been turned into a comic!\n\nKaneko Seika transferred from her life in Tokyo to a high school in Sendai. She's finally got used to life in Sendai, but her main interest is the mysterious beautiful girl, Washio Shiho, who sits next to her and has beautiful black hair and white skin!\n\nWanting to get closer to her, Kaneko tries to approach her in various ways, but she doesn't react well, and sometimes she grins mysteriously to herself… Is this what they call a cool beauty?\n\nOne day after school, Kaneko discovers Washio alone in the classroom. Kaneko tries to talk to her as usual, and Washio runs away as usual, but after that, she finds a notebook with Washio's secret hidden inside…\n\nA relaxed JK observation comedy depicting the daily life of the popular radio character Washio and her eccentric friends in their youth begins!\n___\n**Original Idea Cooperation:** Nippon Broadcasting System “Nogizaka46’s All Night Nippon”\n\n**Additional Explanatory Note:** Washio Shiho is a character created on and for the radio program Nogizaka46's All Night Nippon, hosted by Japanese idol Kubo Shiori, a 3rd generation member of idol group Nogizaka46. Somewhat modeled after Kubo herself, Washio-chan is a baseball fan. Additional character details, such as her forename “Shiho”, family structure, and catchphrases were decided based on listener emails in a segment called “Aim For A Comic Adaptation!! Baseball Girl Washio!!” (めざせマンガ化\\!!野球少女・ワシオ\\!!). Clearly, the name of that segment has now come to fruition with this series.
