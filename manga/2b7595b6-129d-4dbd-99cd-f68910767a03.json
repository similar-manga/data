   "en": "Junta Ueno is newly-qualified and Kousuke Tegoshi is an experienced teacher. They're five years apart in age, and unbeknownst to those around them, they're also lovers. Although Junta always goes full out and is utterly adorkable, he still has a long way to go as a teacher. Kousuke's always finding ways to criticize his work, so the two of them fight constantly.  \n  \nJunta just wants to be as good a teacher as Kousuke is, which is why he ends up trying too hard and making mistakes… but then he finds out that Kousuke has been covering for him in secret! Even though Junta can be ridiculous and frustrating to no end, Kousuke loves every part of him. This is a secret-love comedy between two teachers that's full of awkward situations!"
