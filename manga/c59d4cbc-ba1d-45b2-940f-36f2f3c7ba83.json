   "en": "The story takes place in a world that resembles 19th century Europe. When a carnival comes to town one day, Ray, the son of a bar owner, meets a girl with wings. The girl's name is Vendemiaire. She was given life by her Creator and tells Ray that she is not human.  \n  \nThis is a series of short stories showing the kindness and cruelty of mankind. You can enjoy pictures drawn with a fine touch alongside the philosophic dialogue of the characters.  \n  \nThis 2-volume series is the debut work of Mr. Kitoh. Hints for his next work, Narutaru can also be found in this story."

However, his work is not categorized as lolicon and shotacon.\n\nCharacters he draws are almost always tall, skinny, and gangly for their ages and genders. His females, unlike those of most manga series, generally have small breasts and narrow hips. His males are rarely muscular, except under a few circumstances, usually extreme close-ups. Facial features are, usually, small and expressions subtle. Nudity is common in his works. \n\nSource: [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/author/wrffygg/kitoh-mohiro)"
