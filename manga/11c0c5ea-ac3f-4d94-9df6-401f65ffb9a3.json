   "en": "Sawa applies to Heaven’s Wing Academy, thinking she would look cute in the uniform. But she never expected the academy to be a previously all-boys’ school! And the head honcho of the school, the class president himself—Ran—doesn’t seem to like her one bit and takes no pains to hide it. At first, adjusting to life at the academy is tough. Sawa is bullied and teased, and the boys in the class even throw her new shoes in the water. While attempting to retrieve her shoes, she falls into the water and is unexpectedly saved by Ran, who up until this point has made her life hell. The newfound gentleness in Ran intrigues her—and she finds herself falling for him. What will her days be like for the rest of her school life?  \n  \n*Includes the following side stories called:  \n- Endless March in vol. 1  \nYayoi, a student studying piano, can't get along with her teacher, Terawaki.

She has always lived in the station, collecting stories from travelers and then telling them to others. But why does she remain at the station?"
