   "en": "Sawamura, who belongs to the track and field club of a pharmaceutical company, is a famous sprinter who once finished 7th in the Olympics. However, he had now passed his peak as a player and was frustrated because he could not get the record he wanted. One day, out of the blue, according to the company's policy, a strict order was given to all players who could not break 10.40 in the time trial to leave the club. The players panicked, but it was clear that Sawamura had the highest chance of quitting. A depressed Sawamura is advised by sports doctor Amamiya to become a test subject for a certain experiment. She says she implants tiny devices into his body that tap into his physical potential and enhance his reflexes. Sawamura gives in to Amamiya's persuasion and the temptation to keep the players alive, and undergoes surgery. Ten days later, in the time trial, Sawamura set an astounding record of 10.26 seconds despite being clearly late. Sawamura is elated by a feeling he has never experienced before. However, after that, abnormal phenomena begin to occur in Sawamura's body, such as the feeling that time around him has stopped. On the other hand, the director of the track and field club suspects doping, and the long-standing relationship of trust collapses. The situation progressed beyond Sawamura's expectations."
