   "en": "Collection of short stories.  \n  \n- Red Umbrella, White Umbrella  \nAbout two friends and their ideas about femininity.  \n  \n- Stuffed Animals' Insides  \nA girl sees a friend (who also happens to be her crush) changing herself to attract the attention of a boy.  \n  \n- Weeds on the Wayside  \nA girl who's pretending she likes girls.  \n  \n- Tiger Lily  \nAn old woman remembers the past. A helpful bit of information: the two main characters are drawn as their younger selves even in the scenes that take place in the present.  \n  \n- Short Cut  \nIf imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then the main character of Takahashi Mako's \"Short Cut\" is certainly being paid a great compliment… unfortunately, she doesn't see it that way.  \n  \n- Splinters of Rock Candy  \nA girl worries over what to get her friend.  \n  \n- Natsu no Mayu  \nAbout a girl who admires her friend. Also deals with coming-of-age issues a bit.  \n  \n- Sandals  \nA girl has crush on her best friend.  \n  \n- Next to Her  \nThe main character fixates on her boyfriend's ex.  \n  \n- Maidens' Cake  \nTwo girls share a \"wedding cake.\"\n"
