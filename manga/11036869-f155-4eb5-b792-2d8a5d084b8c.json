   "en": "A Girl Who Came Back From California Lives At My House! ? It's too free-spirited, and I'm at a loss where to focus my eyes! While her parents were away, Mr. Shimakawa, who was longing for her, came to visit her house. But suddenly a girl I don't know rushes in and hugs me and gives me a hot kiss! ? She lived across the street when she was young, Mayumi-chan! She seemed to have run away from America, and she said, \"She'll be here for the time being,\" and started taking a shower with her own face. Even in such a dangerous situation, Mr. Shimakawa came to visit...!?"
