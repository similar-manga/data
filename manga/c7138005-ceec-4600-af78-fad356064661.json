   "en": "Let's La Gon is a gag manga series revolving around a young boy named Gon, his father, and pet bear Beramatcha, as they lead a dysfunctional life of poverty, and the bizarre antics that go on in their lives. The manga is known for being somewhat darker and more surreal than other works from it's author, Akatsuka, making for an experience unlike many other gag comedy manga."

     "en": "Fujio Akatsuka (赤塚 不二夫, Akatsuka Fujio, September 14, 1935 – August 2, 2008) was a pioneer Japanese artist of comical manga known as the Gag Manga King. His name at birth is 赤塚 藤雄, whose Japanese pronunciation is the same as 赤塚 不二夫.\n\nHe was born in Rehe, Manchuria, the son of a Japanese military police officer. After World War II, he grew up in Niigata Prefecture and Nara Prefecture. When he was 19, he moved to Tokyo.\n\nWhile working at a chemical factory, he drew many manga. After that, Tokiwa-so accepted him. He started his career as a shōjo artist, but in 1958, his Nama-chan (ナマちゃん) became a hit, so he became a specialist in comic manga. He won the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1964 for Osomatsu-kun and the Bungeishunjū Manga Award in 1971 for Tensai Bakabon. He is said to have been influenced by Buster Keaton and MAD magazine.\n\nIn 1965, Akatsuka established his own company \"Fujio Productions Ltd.\".\n\nIn 2000, he drew manga in braille for the blind.\n\nMany of his manga featured supporting characters who ended up becoming more popular and more associated with their series than the main character, such as Papa (Tensai Bakabon), Iyami, Chibita (Osomatsu-kun), and Nyarome (Mōretsu Atarō).\n\nIn April 2002 he was hospitalized for intra-axial hematoma and was said to frequently be in a persistent vegetative state from 2004 until his death. In July 2006, his second wife Machiko, who had been nursing him, suddenly died from a subarachnoid hemorrhage. On August 2, 2008, he died of pneumonia at a hospital in Bunkyō, Tokyo."
