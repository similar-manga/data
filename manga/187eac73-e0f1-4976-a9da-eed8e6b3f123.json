   "en": "Nishimori Tooru (31), an unattractive office worker, is married to the most beautiful woman in the company, Mika-san. From an outsider's point of view, they would be envious of him. However, he has a secret he cannot tell anyone about. The only female he knows is Mika, but Mika had known lots of other men. Because he loves her, he is bothered by this fact. \"It's not possible, and it will never come true…\" After falling off the train tracks, a miracle occurred. This is a twisted but a youthful and pure love story about he who longs for his wife's virginity."
