   "en": "A high-school boy, nicknamed Fuu-chan, stays with his relatives in the countryside to study for his college entrance exams, and to get away from the sweltering Tokyo heat.   \n  \nThere, he wakes up to an unexpected encounter with Kii-chan, an early-bloomer preteen who initiates a pure, erotic story that must be kept secret from parents.  \n   \nYamamoto Naoki, the mangaka behind the adult classic \"Blue,\" returns with his first new series since the end of his award-winning historical manga \"Red.\"  \n\n\n---\n\nNote: This title was initially labeled \"hentai\" by the scanlator because it is heavy on explicit depictions of sexual acts and it is relatively light on story. The label has since been removed by moderators.  \n  \nHowever, the book has been released without the 18-plus label, and the Tokyo metropolitan government responded on Sept. 10 by declaring the title an \"unhealthy publication\" that \"obstructs the healthy development of youth.\" This has caused Amazon Japan to de-platform the book.  \n  \nThis echoes what happened to \"Blue\" in the past: the book was initially published as an all-ages manga, then it was later discontinued and resold as an adult publication after the government listed \"Blue\" as harmful.  \n  \nNote: This title placed 13th in the \"Kono Manga ga Sugoi!\" 2021 ranking for male readers.  \n[Anime News Network](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-12-17/kono-manga-ga-sugoi-editors-unveil-2021-rankings/.167435)"
