    "en": "Ai, wishing to become an idol as famous as her mother once was, has been participating in tests at various talent agencies, but she has failed every single one of them. Her inability to even begin to follow into her mother's footsteps becomes a complex to her. As Ai bursts into tears, alone in a public park, she is approached by 765 Production idol Haruka Amami, who was a special judge at one of the tests Ai has taken. Having sensed something special about Ai's singing, Haruka comforts her and introduces her to 876 Production's president Ishikawa. The president is very quick to invite Ai into 876, as she believes that her mother's name alone should be enough to propel Ai to the top. Ai protests, stating that she wants to become an idol using only her own strength. She is then given one chance to prove herself, at a rookie idol audition.\r\n\r\nPart of [url=https://mangadex.org/?page=search\u0026title=iDOLM%40STER]THE iDOLM@STER[/url] series."
