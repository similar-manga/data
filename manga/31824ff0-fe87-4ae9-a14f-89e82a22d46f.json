But after waking up on the next morning, she found that the dog that was sleeping next to her is no where to be found, but in it's place, she found a humanoid dog person sleeping in her bed. Later on, she revealed that she doesn't know quite well how she ended up in that form, but she does know that she is the dog itself. Now Fumiko's normal life has turned upside down with Atsuko around, and their wacky daily life begin."
