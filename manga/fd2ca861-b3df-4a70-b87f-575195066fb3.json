   "en": "Tetsuro Tanaka is a month late starting high school due to an accident. As he's finally able to go, he's almost hit by a truck, but is saved by a mysterious girl who wears the same pendant as the one that his school has. He finds out that he's the only boy in his class and is instantly hated by his classmates except for a few. One girl is Yayoi Asuka, whose name Tetsuro is familiar with as it's the same name as a girl he knew when he was little. A few more girls get introduced, one being Sakuya Kazamatsuri. Yayoi reveals that she has superpowers and she takes him to his dorm, which she is going to share with him along with Sakuya, Miyabi Tsukuyomi, Akio Suzuka, Otome Chouno, Hifumi Inokai, and finally his teacher, Kano."
