After an unexpected kiss from Ichio, will Komada return his feelings?  \n  \n2. The Trap of Love  \nIwami Seiichirou is in love with his beautiful classmate Yuuzaki Midori… unfortunately, Midori is what you call a bubble brain - and really popular in their all-boys school. Iwami has known Midori since middle school, but is just friends enough now?  \n  \n3. I Want A Bit More Love  \nTakanori was Rokuta's classmate in highschool. After meeting each other coincidentally, Rokuta has been eating at Takanori's Italian restaurant every night. When a female editor ends up tagging along with Rokuta one night, complicated feelings arise.  \n  \n4. Youth Melancholic  \nNikaidou is always second to Hirahata, be it in sports or studies. Naturally, Nikaidou thinks of Hirahata as his rival and dislikes him. When Nikaidou goes to buy a pair of glasses, the shop turns out to be owned by Hirahata's family. After that day, the two boys always seem to be together… but why is Hirahata so interested in being around Nikaidou?  \n  \n5. While Numbering Stars  \nYoshino Sakumi noticed his boss, Kashihara Ryouji, looking at him… the way a woman looks at a man. After confirming his suspicions, the two men became engaged in a sexual relationship… but why is Cheif Kashihara so nice to everyone, and why is Yoshino so irritated about it?  \n  \n6. While Numbering Stars Extra  \nYoshino invites Kashihara to his house…. but for the night, or forever?"
