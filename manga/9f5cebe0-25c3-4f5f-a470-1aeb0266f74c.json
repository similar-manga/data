    "en": "The world's first comic masterpiece to fully illustrate the Tiananmen Square Incident! The intensity is comparable to that of \"The Silent Fleet\"! If you love military, history and care about the future, you can't miss it! In June 1989, Morrell, an American journalist, was in Tiananmen Square looking for subjects and mingling with the students in order to cover this once-in-a-lifetime student event in Chinese history. However, on June 4, the square, which was full of forward-looking energy, turned into a bloody and brutal killing field ......! Professors who were baptized by the Cultural Revolution, brothers who were guards at the square and protesting students, top Chinese officials such as Zhao Ziyang, Deng Xiaoping, Yao Yilin and Li Peng, as well as the U.S. government, Taiwan and the world, use a mixture of fiction and reality, together with rigorous historical evidence, to portray the premature arrival of the democratic wave in China from the perspective of all walks of life, the coldest summer of 1989. It has been 17 years since the Tiananmen Square Incident, which has had a huge impact on democratic thinking in modern China and which cannot be ignored in the analysis of the Chinese economy, took place in 1989. Although many written records have been published, no pictorial works have ever been created with this event as the main axis. Since the creators in Hong Kong, China, are unable to create such a theme due to political factors, and the creators in the United States and Japan are not clear about the circumstances, we are the only ones left in the world who can challenge the theme of \"Tiananmen Incident\". Therefore, we tried to reinterpret the \"Tiananmen Incident\", an event that brought a great impact to China and the world, by using the most easily understood and impressive comic book technique. The book is divided into four chapters, each presenting a comprehensive and objective analysis of the Tiananmen Incident in four directions: general, student, senior government, and world. The detailed and rigorous historical and military examinations, as well as the complete timeline of the June Fourth Incident in the appendix at the end of the book, make this book highly valuable as a source of information. It is a must-read for understanding modern China. (MTL'd description)\r\n\r\nRetail: [url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details/?id=VSiWDwAAQBAJ\u0026hl=en_US]Google Play[/url]"
