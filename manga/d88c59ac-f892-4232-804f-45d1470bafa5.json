   "en": "1-3) I Want to be Emasculated  \nSalaryman Hoshina has been sharing an apartment and bed with model Atsushi. Atsushi cooks, cleans, and remembers every anniversary, but Hoshina can't figure out why they are in this \"type\" of relationship. When Hoshina's younger brother moves in for a while, and the boys must endure until he's gone, will Hoshina even care? Will this time of separation be the turning point in their relationship? And which boy will be the one screaming, \"Once is not enough\"?  \n  \n4) Try to Say You Love Me  \nStudent Hasegawa has recently started noticing how cute his friend Hashimoto is, especially around homeroom sensei Sawa. Can Hasegawa cheer Hashimoto on, or will he take his adorable classmate for himself…  \n  \n5) Infection of Feeling  \nMedical intern Ishiguro has been sleeping with his attending Sensei Sakuma for the past year. Their intensely physical relationship is all Ishiguro ever considered, but Sakuma thinks feelings should be involved as well.  \n  \n6-7) Refrain Smile, Sweet Words in the Middle of the Night  \nAizawa can't seem to stop watching artist Shima, that he always sees sketching in the subway station. Shima's gentle smile he gives, even to strangers captivates Aizawa, so he finds himself standing up for the boy in an argument."
