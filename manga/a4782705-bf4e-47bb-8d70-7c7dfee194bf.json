   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nMusashi (Takezo) goes to the dojo of Ishikawa Guntosai Itsukuryu at the behest of his father, a martial arts instructor of the Ogasawara family. As Musashi trains under his teacher, he learns that his father was killed by a man named Sasaki Gentosai Kishiyu, just as Musashi is about to perfect the Nito style he has developed! Knowing that his father was as formidable an opponent as his master, Musashi sets off on a journey to avenge his father's death. Shotaro Ishinomori portrays Musashi Miyamoto as a young boy with a lot of charm, just as in the Tachikawa Bunko, a collection of written stories published for young people in the Taisho era (1912-1926)."

Like most of the Japanese artists, Ishimori was influenced by Tezuka Osamu. In 1956, he formed a coterie group with Akatsuka Fujio, Nagashima Shinji and Suzuki Mitsuaki. He moved to Tokyo after graduation, where he continued to work as a mangaka, starting with the war story Kaiketsu Harimao in 1959. Subsequently, he produced hit mangas such as the science fiction series Cyborg 009 (1964) and the historical series Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae (Big Comic, 1968-72). In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category. In 1989, he commenced working on a large series about the history of Japan, Manga Nihon no Rekishi, which remained unfinished due to the artist's death on January 28th, 1998 at the age of 60.\n\nIshinomori was nicknamed the 'King of Manga' and is considered one of the pioneers of modern manga.
