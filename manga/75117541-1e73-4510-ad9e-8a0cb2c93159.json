The discovery of her mother's family in Bha'Khar, a desert kingdom far away from the States, fills her with much wonder and anxiety. As she leaves for Bha'Khar, she is surprised to find a royal jet as well as Sheikh Kardahl, second in line to the throne, waiting for her. To Jessica's amazement, he says, \"You are my betrothed, chosen by my family. You are my bride.\"\r\n\r\nVolume 2 ~ The Sheikh's Contract Bride (Ai o Suteta Sheikh)\r\n\r\nBeth would do anything for her twin sister, Addie, who has been betrothed to a sheikh from young age and has led a life of high expectation and heavy responsibility. Beth, unlike her sister, spent a lonesome childhood receiving little attention from her parents. The twins have grown up trusting and depending on each other. As the day of meeting the sheikh nears, Addie confides in Beth with her secret love for another man. To save her dearest Addie, Beth decides to go to the desert kingdom of Bha'Khar, pretending to be her twin sister!"
