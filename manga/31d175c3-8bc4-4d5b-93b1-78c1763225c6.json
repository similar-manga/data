   "en": "The Abashiri family has just moved into town. And they're the meanest, toughest, roughest bunch you're ever going to meet. From the grandfather to the daughter to the smallest child. And they take true glee from what they do - from kicking the asses of the town toughs, to kicking a family out of their home, to engineering prison breaks, to maiming cops. No one comes tougher.\nAnd oh yes, it's a comedy, a total nonsense gag comedy."
