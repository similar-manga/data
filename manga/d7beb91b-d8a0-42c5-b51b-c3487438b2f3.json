   "en": "Haight and Andrews are successful engineers working for a company on the verge of developing a history-making breakthrough on nanotechnology; however, when Haight discovers a new technology that will help people live better and cure a few diseases, Andrews decides to use this technology for military purposes. Aware of his intentions, Haight resigns from the company taking all the documents and research about his discovery with him. Andrews becomes angry at this and prepares a trap for Haight. Andrews and his five maniac sidekicks brutally torture Haight and kill his loved ones, then sever both his arms and leave him for dead.  \n  \nLuckily Haight is rescued by a mysterious doctor and his assistant. Both men are experimenting with the strange power of \"The Zetsmos,\" which is the ability to control the ghost inside the body while one is still alive. Reports of people that had their limbs severed confirm that they can still \"feel and move\" their limbs even if they are not there, but with the Natural power of the Zetsmos, the body can assimilate any kind of materia and make it part of the body (such as wood, paper, water, metal, etc.) and recreate the limb that was gone.  \n  \nHowever, awakening the Zetsmos is a painful and dangerous process; the bearer has to put himself between life and death to awaken it. But Haight will stop at nothing to hunt down those that made his life a living hell, and he's determined to use the mysterious power to carry on his revenge.\n\n**Wikipedia**\n- [Italian](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A4mons)\n- [Japanese](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%80%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A2%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BA)"

     "en": "Osamu Tezuka (手塚 治虫, b. 手塚 治, Tezuka Osamu; 3 November 1928 – 9 February 1989) was a Japanese manga artist, cartoonist, and animator. Born in Osaka Prefecture, his prolific output, pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres earned him such titles as \"the Father of Manga\" (マンガの父, Manga no Chichi), \"the Godfather of Manga\" (マンガの教父, Manga no Kyōfu) and \"the God of Manga\" (マンガの神様, Manga no Kami-sama). \n\nTezuka began what was known as the manga revolution in Japan with his [New Treasure Island](https://mangadex.org/title/63487511-434d-4a98-a1da-13bf80e9fcb8/new-treasure-island-1947) published in 1947. His output would spawn some of the most influential, successful, and well-received manga series including the children mangas [Astro Boy](https://mangadex.org/title/ca4c84bb-7272-45aa-a22d-dc1282b52372/tetsuwan-atom), [Princess Knight](https://mangadex.org/title/eb1b4f6f-8bc2-40a5-9398-768f5d4aea01/princess-knight-1953) and [Kimba the White Lion](https://mangadex.org/title/bad33763-70c6-40b7-8d14-190556fc55f0/jungle-emperor), and the adult-oriented series [Black Jack](https://mangadex.org/title/fd86eab2-f0f3-47d3-bce5-5628e97f37dc/black-jack), [Phoenix](https://mangadex.org/title/cc647d62-3a2c-474b-ac4e-844256ab185d/hi-no-tori), and [Buddha](https://mangadex.org/title/4e102d46-0a98-4249-8a42-98e4705b663e/buddha), all of which won several awards.\n\nTezuka died of stomach cancer in 1989. His death had an immediate impact on the Japanese public and other cartoonists. A museum was constructed in Takarazuka dedicated to his memory and life works, and Tezuka received many posthumous awards. "
