   "en": "\"I'll live, I'll live whatever I want. Even if I eat mud ... !!\" Hitoko, who was born as the third daughter of the old family, Kotozawa, said, \"I want you to live the flow of the world with your eyes.\" As the name suggests from my father's wishes, I was skeptical about the way of life of a woman who was forced under the vulgar thoughts of men and women in the world. However, she is forcibly recommended by Hitoko for her matchmaking that does not suit her, and she will be married to a wealthy man and a clerk. Her sister-in-law, her sister-in-law, chord, hates her, but Hitoko decides to live with her parents-in-law as a clerk, but the bombing of Tokyo hits that place. A human drama comic depicting the lives of women who survived the chaotic world of World War II and the postwar reconstruction period from the beginning of the Showa period.\n\nsource: mangaupdates"
