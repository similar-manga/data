   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nBased on the Suntory Prize-award-winning book, this is the first manga serialized in JAL's in-flight magazine!　In the 18th century, the \"Grand Tour\" was popular among British aristocrats, who sent their children to the European continent for international education. With experienced tutors as chaperones and ample financial resources, the grand tours lasted from a year at the shortest to five or six years at times. From the start of the trip, they traveled through France and Italy until they returned home. The young man was greeted not only by high culture and traditions, but also by bad roads, cheap accommodations, swindlers, and prostitutes. A vivid portrayal of the customs of the time!"

In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category.
