She continues to take care of Shuzo Umehara, the former boss of the Umehara group, which has already been dissolved. Due to Umehara's continued debauchery and debauchery, the troubles and debts are irrelevant, but the three of them still can't abandon the former boss. There is no prospect of paying the 10 million yen debt of the gambling house created by Umehara, and Shinkawa and his friends kill Morimoto, the young leader of the Mibukai gang who came to collect it. In Mibukai's retaliation, Iyama loses his right hand, but uses a 9-year-old throwing knife master, Ricky, to assassinate the Mibukai boss. Ricky's older sister and sukeban Kimie becomes Onimaru's mistress. At the end of the conflict, Shinkawa was seriously injured, Iyama died, and Onimaru was captured by the police."
