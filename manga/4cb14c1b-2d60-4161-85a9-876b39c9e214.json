   "en": "Shurato (Akito Hidaka) , a hot-blooded boy who loves fighting and has a good mood, and Gai (Gai Kuroki) , who has a quiet and loving personality . Although the two had very different personalities, they were best friends.\n\nHowever, the two were wrapped in a big light during the karate match. When Shurat wakes up alone, he is told by Vishnu, the god of harmony , that this is a different world from the human world, the \"heavenly world.\" He is told that he was one of the members of the group, \"Shurao\".\n\nHowever, immediately after that, Indra, the thunder emperor of the deva army, suddenly rebelled, turned Vishnu into stone, and ordered Shurat to subjugate him. Shurat and his friends, who were sent to a distant land by Vishnu's last power, set out on a journey to the heavenly palace in order to defeat Indra and save Vishnu and the heavenly world.\n\nStanding in their way are their former companions. Among them is Gai, who reincarnated as \"King of Yasha\", changed into a cruel personality after Shiva's spell encased him in a black stream of light, and relentlessly pursues the life of Shurat."
