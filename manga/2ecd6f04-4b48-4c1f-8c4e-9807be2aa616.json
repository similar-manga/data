   "en": "1) Amai Kimi ga Suki  \nKawakami is a top student with a penchant for donuts. Kaji is a troublemaker who fell deeply in love with Kawakami. Although they ignore each other at school, when they're all alone… they eat, kiss and… play. “You're so annoying!” is Kawakami's favorite line, but there's much more than meets the eye. A cute story of an unusual first love!  \n  \n2) Rising from the Ashes, Kaji-kun  \nAmai Kimi ga Suki extra  \n  \n3) Dangan Baby  \nOnce again Noda has been rejected by his one-sided crush. As he tries to drink his heartbreak away, he gets picked on. Unexpectedly, a stranger comes to his rescue. The next morning, he wakes up naked in an unknown bed and catches a glimpse into his savior's half-open suitcase: There he spots - a gun…? Just who is this mysterious stranger?  \n  \n4) Let's go wild, Baby  \nDangan Baby extra  \n  \n5) The Kitten and the Prince / The Cat and the King  \nOosado works as a researcher on pheromones and keeps Goro, a giant pet cat, at his laboratory. Most people keep away from him because of his cat. Only the medical student Tojo gets along with Goro splendidly. Why is it that Oosado always feels irritated by the animal-attracting lad?  \n  \n6) Telephone!  \nMaki is very shy when it comes to answering phone calls. To cure his phone phobia, his superior Sasamoto decides to call his house phone every day. Soon Maki's anxiety fades - and he begins to anticipate the calls…?  \n  \n7) Beautiful Thing / Beloved  \nSugita is staying in the hospital because of his broken leg. A regular Japanese hospital if it weren't for his attending physician, Dr Yamada. The bright blonde beauty of a doctor seems to stick out like a sore thumb in Sugita's perception. That is until he witnesses an exchange between Dr Yamada and one of his collegues…  \n  \n8) Your Favorite Song  \nAtsurou has inherited the piano-tuning skills from his renowned grandfather and so far, business has been going well. That is until he receives a much anticioated request from the Benriya house to fix their antique piano. No matter what he does, the piano's young owner cannot be satisfied with his piano-tuning. Just what is wrong with this piano and its owner…?  \n  \n9) After  \nYour Favorite Song extra  \n  \nNote: The scanlator combined chapters 2 \u0026 3 into one chapter, and did the same with chapters 4 \u0026 5. He then renumbered the remaining chapters."
