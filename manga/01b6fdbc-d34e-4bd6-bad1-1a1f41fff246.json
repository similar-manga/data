   "en": "Vol. 1 - Somehow Nagi Tokieda, a student of a prestigious boarding high school, Ouka Gakkan, is loved by Yuushi Kitou, a perfect sophomore, chosen as a president of the school council though he is still a 2nd year. Nagi is a lonely boy, dumped by his real parents, and is always very sensitive about people's affection to him. Yuushi plans Nagi's birthday party to encourage him. But hearing the news of Nagi's father returning home, he suspends the party. It was a false alert. From shock, Nagi follows some strange students of another school without any definite purpose and gets into danger.  \n  \nVol. 2 - Many allies and even more enemies… A scandal breaks out surrounding the tremendously popular, charismatic, and beautiful student council president! Under the scrutinizing and hostile eye of the journalism club’s Katakura, Yuushi’s plans have been recalled. On top of that, Yuushi’s become the target of the ever-capable and ever-cool vice president Takamura’s rabid fans’ jealousy!! How will he respond to their constant criticism?! [from Juné]"
