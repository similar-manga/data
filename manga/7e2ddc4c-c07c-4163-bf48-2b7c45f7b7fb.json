   "en": "Komatsu \"Hachi\" Nana is a 20-year-old Genki Girl from the countryside with a bad habit of falling in love at first sight.   \nOosaki Nana is a 20-year-old punk rocker from a different small city, who's coming off a bad breakup with her boyfriend (and former bass player of her band).   \nWhen \"Hachi\" decides to follow her boyfriend to Tokyo, and the other Nana heads there to start her music career, the two young women meet by chance on a snowbound train. They rent an apartment together several days later.   \nSurprisingly realistic drama and an oddly romantic friendship ensues.  \n  \n- Won the Shogakukan Manga Award in shoujo category for 2002.\n  \nThe manga is currently on an indefinite hiatus since 2009 due to the author's health issues."
