   "en": "One year after the original series was axed, Kimito and his commoner club friends have pretty much carry on with their life, occasionally talking about the old days with nostalgic feelings on Twitter. Aika on the other hands, doesn't accept the reality and demands Kimito to teach her how to make Shomin Sample live again - to this end, Kimito decided to write a Doujinshi that continues the story on \"what if\" routes, using original raw to visualize his concept. He expects no one'd be interested in the idea so he won't have to actually write anything, but that's where his biggest mistake lies…  \n  \nNOTE: This doujinshi makes use of raw from original series to visualize the story."
