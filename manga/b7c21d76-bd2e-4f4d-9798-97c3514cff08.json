   "en": "Kyo, a young man who lost his family, finds a man unconscious in front of his house and lets him rest in his house since he could get in trouble if he died there, but when the man wakes up he suddenly jumps at Kyo and says “Let me eat you…!!”\n\nThat man, Ren, was actually a demon!!!\nHe tells Kyo that if he doesn’t eat a human’s energy regularly he’ll disappear and that the most delicious energy comes from people who are having sex, so he asks Kyo to have sex with him, but his invitation is firmly rejected! \nKyo planned to kick him out as soon as possible, but since he didn’t have many opportunities to talk with someone, he decides to let him stay in his house.\n\nKyo was supposed to think that Ren was a nuisance, but he lived alone for so long that he started to have feelings for Ren during the lively days he spent with him. And so, Ren’s presence in his life got stronger by the day. However, Kyo had a reason that made it impossible for him to give Ren “delicious energy”."
