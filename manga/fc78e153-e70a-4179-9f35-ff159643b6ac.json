   "en": "The town of Hoori lies deep in the middle of the mountains, inaccessible by rail. Since there isn’t much interaction with its surroundings, the town seems like it is stuck in the past. However, it is because of this exact olden feel and subsequent development that it has turned into a nice hot-springs town for tourists.  \n  \nOne of the popular sightseeing spots is the sacred sword Murasamemaru, embedded in a stone. No one has been able to pull it out… until Masaomi somehow broke it in half. He has to take responsibility for his actions by “Marrying” the ‘shrine maiden’ Yoshino. Masaomi was perplexed at the unexpected turn of events, but this is only just the beginning. What lies ahead for him is a much more peculiar and mysterious life, including his new fiancee, a mysterious girl who only he could touch, and the secret behind the curse that remains on the town.  \n  \nWhat will become of Masaomi’s love amidst his rapidly changing life? The answer lies within the Murasamemaru in his hands."
