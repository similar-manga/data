His motto is to put the client's feelings first), Kanon Omi (Takumi Design Office) The only employee of the company.I like Takumi!?), Ganzo Oumi (Kanon's father and the master carpenter of the shrine. A fan of Ryosuke Takumi) ●Synopsis: A woman visits the Takumi Design Office\n. She wants to design a house to live with her grandparents, but the woman's father is the design manager of the industry's top figure design office. When Ryosuke asks, \"Why is that so?\", it is said that his grandfather, who is also an architect, and his father had a violent confrontation over the new house, and that caused his grandfather to collapse. Therefore, in order to build the house that his grandfather wants, he wants to ask Ryosuke, who will be properly present at the demolition of the client's house, to design it. However, the other party is an architect who is the best in the industry. There is no guarantee of winning, so Ryosuke accepts the job (episode 1).\n▼Ryosuke is going to design the house of Mr. Ito, who is the coach of Dainichi Steel Basketball. However, although he had a meeting with his wife, Mr. Ito, who is the owner of the house, did not come to the meeting no matter how many times he called. When I asked him about it, he said that he was too busy with basketball practice to come home. Reluctantly, Ryosuke visits the practice field, but Mr. Ito refuses to listen, saying, \"I leave the housework to his wife.\" Ryosuke is utterly at a loss, but when he sees Mr. Ito lying happily asleep sprawled in the gymnasium, he comes up with something (Episode 2).\n●Other data/Columns recorded by university professors and professional designers = \"You can build a house cheaply if you ask an architect.\" Maximize the use of nature.” “To hand down a good old house to the next generation.” “How to live in your own house until the end.”"
