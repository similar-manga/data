   "en": "**From Toriyama's World:**  \nYaiba's whole life has been spent training to be a samurai and he doesn't know about anything else, not even girls. When he returns to Japan, a pair of cursed swords makes life even more exciting… and hilarious.  \n  \nNote: Starting at chapter 80, EMS Team started using bunko scans, so the volume numbering is a little different.  \n  \nIn 1993 Yaiba received the Shogakukan Manga Award."
