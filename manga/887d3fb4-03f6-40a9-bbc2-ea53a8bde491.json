Eventually, he became famous as an illustrator featured in Comiket (short for Comic Market, a comic convention bi-annually held in Japan). He used the pen name Awa Mizuno (水野 亜和, MIZUNO Awa). Akamatsu, still in college, then proceeded to win the Weekly Shonen Magazine award twice. His \"A Kid's Game for One Summer\" was awarded the coveted 50th Shonen Magazine Newcomer's Award soon after he graduated. After a big hit with A.I. Love You, he finally made a grand success with his new manga, Love Hina.
