   "en": "Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time! High school student Kazuki Muto had no clue what he was in for when he rescued damsel in distress Tokiko from a monster known as a \"homunculus.\" Disguised as humans–who actually eat humans–homunculi are malevolent creatures that affix themselves to people's brains, and once fully grown, the only thing that can annihilate them is a weapon called Buso Renkin! Follow the adventures of Kazuki after he discovers that it was actually Tokiko who saved his life by implanting a kakugane–an alchemical device that transforms into a buso renkin–to replace his heart!"

     "en": "Nobuhiro Nishiwaki (Japanese: 西脇 伸宏, Hepburn: Nishiwaki Nobuhiro, born May 26, 1970), better known by his pen name Nobuhiro Watsuki (和月 伸宏, Watsuki Nobuhiro), is a Japanese manga artist. He is best known for his samurai-themed series Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story (1994–1999), which has over 70 million copies in circulation and a sequel he is currently creating titled Rurouni Kenshin: The Hokkaido Arc (2017–present). He has written three more series, the western *Gun Blaze West* (2001), the supernatural *Buso Renkin* (2003–2005), and the horror manga *Embalming -The Another Tale of Frankenstein-* (2007–2015). Watsuki has mentored several well-known manga artists, including One Piece creator [Eiichiro Oda](https://mangadex.org/author/b6045e2c-28f4-4ce0-b4dd-b14070f2f5ae/oda-eiichiro), [Hiroyuki Takei](https://mangadex.org/author/a3088532-5bc2-414f-b43c-8525e1b723f0/takei-hiroyuki) of Shaman King fame, and Mr. Fullswing author [Shinya Suzuki](https://mangadex.org/author/26d971d0-0a3c-46f6-977e-cde9c07808f0/suzuki-shinya).\n\nIn November 2017, police found DVDs with footage of naked girls in their early teens in Watsuki's Tokyo office. Tokyo Police raided Watsuki's home as part of an investigation into the purchase of child pornography. The search uncovered DVDs containing videos of naked girls less than 18 years of age. He was referred to prosecutors over possession of child pornography on November 21. The serialization of Rurouni Kenshin: The Hokkaido Arc was put on hiatus after the details of Watsuki's charges were made public. In February 2018, Watsuki was fined ¥200,000. The Hokkaido Arc resumed serialization in June 2018."
