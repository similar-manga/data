   "en": "Takahashi Akane, a 30 year-old office worker, is an ordinary beta female. She has someone that she really loves and he is her childhood friend, Takarai Yuusuke, a cool and capable alpha male. However, alphas usually only seek omegas as their mates... After taking the secondary gender test in their third year of middle school, Akane learned that she is a beta and thus, became brokenhearted... \n\nThe two became more estranged over time and now at 30, she was hospitalised after feeling unwell and that's where she met Yuusuke again, who's now a researcher there. Akane was happy for their reunion but Yuusuke suddenly went into \"heat\" and assaulted her. She's just a beta so there's no way that Yuusuke, an alpha, would go into heat because of her. But while whispering to her, \"My omega...\", he tried to bite her nape ..!?"
