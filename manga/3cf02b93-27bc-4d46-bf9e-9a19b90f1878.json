   "en": "1) Nude  \nNatsuki is getting ready to graduate, and she wants her final art project to be Tsuji, fellow art student and crush of three years. Will she be able to complete it?  \n  \n2) Hold me in the Summer  \nNagisa's summer vacation seems like it will be uneventful, except she keeps running into the handsome Yuuji. Can this be a summer romance, or maybe something more?  \n  \n3) Christmas Passion  \nMiyako is constantly being sexually harassed by Atsushi. He interrupts when she's being confessed to and is always touching her. But Miyako can't forgive him for hurting her years before.   \n  \n4) Red Hot Blizzard  \nKazuno's sister drags her along on a skiing retreat. Her sister's boyfriend also brings his brother, Aoi. The two get closer through mishaps, but is this meeting more than a coincidence?   \n  \n5) Valentine Ecstasy  \nMadoka has been having sexy dreams of Akashi, probably because he's always teasing her! He has so many girls around him, she won't even give him obligatory chocolate. Can Akashi change her mind?"
