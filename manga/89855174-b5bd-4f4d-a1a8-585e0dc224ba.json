   "en": "The story of a paediatrician from the creator of Theseus no Fune.\r\n\r\nThe sound that connects life--\r\nA precious sound that resembles what only can be said to be a miracle--\r\n\r\nDeclining birth rates, monster parents, convenience store medical tests...\r\nIn a hostile environment where societal problems are stacked against the odds of paediatricians,\r\nthey spend their days tirelessly to ensure that their patients are receiving the best care available to prevent any missed sightings of any major illness that could be hidden in their patients.\r\n\r\nLiking your patients alone isn't enough to sustain the cost/effective ratio of one's passion in this field where mental health for paediatricians can succumb to despair; although, there seems to be one amidst this field who somehow retains his gentle smile throughout it all, and his name is Mako Suzukake.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a warm, and sincere paediatrician who watches over his patients from the cradle until their first steps into adulthood, as well as the family who accompany their child throughout their journey of life."
