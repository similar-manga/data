   "en": "A collection of four short stories by Fuyumi Souryou.  \n  \nThe Rainbow Fish is a story about a painter and her problems dealing with a culture that doesn't leave too much space for artistic inspiration. From a little girl to adulthood, Sari struggles to show how she sees life through her eyes. This story is something of an autobiography.  \n  \nDamned Sun is about a cynical girl who isn't very enthusiastic about most things teenagers like. She meets a man, a funny, interesting gangster. They get along very well from the beginning, understanding each other without too many words… But it only lasts one day, since what shakes Maki from her apathy can't last long…  \n  \nStrange Trait asks the question: Are human beings are like groceries? Do they really have a certain durability? A writer thinks so, and she bases her novel on the idea.  \n  \nA Strange Gene is about Ayano Yoshimusa; a superb worker, efficient, accurate, and cold. Saegusa, her colleague, is her opposite: messy, chaotic and warm. He admires his boss, whenever he talks to her he realises what a perfect creature she is. But as always, not everything is what it seems. When a sixteen years old appears and tells him she lives with Ayano, Saegusa seems to perceive that something might be hidden under the perfect appearance of this beautiful woman."
