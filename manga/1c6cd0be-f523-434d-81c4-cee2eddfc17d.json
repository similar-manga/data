What's more, the costume is possessed by a man's spirit, and he says that he wants to become an ally of justice, which he was unable to do during his lifetime. Inspired by the spirit of special effects, Kagura and Kagura, a member of the club, plan to make Necroman play an active role in reality as a \"dead man of justice\".\n\nIn the beginning, the words started by dealing with the incidents that occurred in the school, but they gradually encountered incidents that exceeded common sense. At that time, crimes committed by people with supernatural powers called \"Knockers\" became a problem in the world. Words declared a battle with Necroman against them, who are perfect for villains who change into strange shapes and do evil things."
