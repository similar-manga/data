    "en": "1-3) While moving into his new apartment, Kinishita was not careful and knocked over some heavy boxes. It was lucky that mover Manaka was there to protect him and take the damage in his stead. But now Manaka is injured at home and Kinishita can't help but worry about him and... thinking about him.\r\n\r\n4-5) Horiuchi's relationships never last long. He prefers to keep his distance, especially from his gay coworker Nimura, who has stated pretty bluntly that he's in love with Horiuchi and pursues him relentlessly. But Horiuchi doesn't do man x man relationships, and even if he does, would Nimura have enough energy to love him?\r\n\r\n6-7) Fuji has been in love with his playboy boss for a long time, and while said boss is oblivious to his feelings, coworker Ekinoda isn't. Ekinoda wants Fuji to notice him, but how can Fuji do that when the boss is around? Would a special kind of party change his mind?"
