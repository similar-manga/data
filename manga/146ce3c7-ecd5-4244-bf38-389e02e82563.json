   "en": "As a manga tie-in for the then ongoing anime in 1966, this spin-off was serialized for a younger audience. As a little lion cub in the jungle, Leo must find a way to stop an aggressive red rhinoceros from hurting his jungle friends. Watch a boxing match between Leo and a rogue lion, Bubu. Help Leo save a brave hero as he gets revenge on Lubar, an elderly leopard. Finally, learn about Laiya's brother and how a hydra-snake was able to devour their entire family. \n\nThese chapters of the Shogakukan Sunday Comics were re-released in 1994 as part of the Complete Works with [Adventure Ruby](https://mangadex.org/title/472e7ce7-9a56-4e1d-9ed3-0acf1cf1bc2a/adventure-ruby) (冒険ルビ, Bouken Ruby)."
