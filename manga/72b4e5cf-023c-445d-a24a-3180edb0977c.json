When one day, bad luck strikes him hard. he breaks his arm and because of a roof leak, his home is a mess. He's at a complete loss, when the Head Priest of the nearby temple comes to his aid, offering to let him live at the temple for the time being. However, he's astonished when he's introduced to the Head Priest's son. Standing in front of him was the only man who'd ever stolen the No.1 position from Chiharu - a former junior host: Fujinami!

And Chiharu's tense mind and body unravel....?"
