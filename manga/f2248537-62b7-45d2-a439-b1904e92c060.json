   "en": "Welcome to the vampire city of Saruta, where the sun never rises, and all the vampire children love trying to stay up late. Hipira is a precocious young vampire whose best friend is a fairy named Soul. Hipira and Soul are an odd couple to say the least, and their games, pranks, and adventures are extraordinary even for dwellers of this supernatural city.  \n  \nHipira is a delightfully bright twist to traditionally dark subject matter. Filled with fun, wonder, and heart, the illustrations look like they have been pulled off the screen of a top-flight animated feature. Hipira is a children's book like no other, one that will appeal to readers of all ages."

     "en": "**Katsuhiro Otomo** (大友 克洋, Ōtomo Katsuhiro, born April 14, 1954) is a Japanese manga artist, screenwriter, animator and film director. Together with [Miyazaki Hayao](https://mangadex.org/author/6cdfb695-afc4-43af-bf76-20b2a4b37a7f/miyazaki-hayao) and [Mamoru Oshii](https://mangadex.org/author/1530ea1e-ba08-4dee-b2e6-a96b93849757/mamoru-oshii), they are known as the \"three giants of Japanese animation directors\".\n\nIn 1954, Otomo was born in Miyagi Prefecture. When he was young, he was deeply influenced by Tezuka's *Astro Boy* and *Jungle Emperor*, and determined to become a manga artist in middle school. In 1980, he began to serialize his famous work *Domu*, and in 1982, he began to serialize his most famous work *Akira*. In 1983, he began to participate in the production of animated films, and produced the animated film *Akira* based on his own manga in 1988, which achieved great success. Then his creative focus gradually shifted to animated films.\n\n\"A boy with extraordinary abilities stands on the ruins of Tokyo, and everyone will say that this is Katsuhiro Otomo.\" said by Miyazaki Hayao.\n"
