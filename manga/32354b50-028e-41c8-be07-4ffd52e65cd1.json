And when she thinks things can't get any worse, she gets her wrist broken by the car accident caused by her friend. She then commands him to be her slave until her wrist is healed.  \n  \n2) A Fiery Kiss on a Rooftop:  \nWith the party girl's hands forced by her parents to either get a teaching license or have her allowance cut off, she caves. Begrudgingly, she sets off for her practicum at a high school.  \n  \n3) His Feverish Glance:  \nWith her wedding nine months away and a comfortable life seemingly in her lap, she helps a handsome stranger out when he was being pursued.  \n  \n4) The House Touched by a Spirit:  \nA trip with her married co-worker to Hokkaido ends disastrously after he chickens out after his wife contacts him. The girl tries to hitch a ride to town from a passing stranger but he brings her home instead."
