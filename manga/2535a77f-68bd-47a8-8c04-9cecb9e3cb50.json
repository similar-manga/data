Although they are living together peacefully but there is a secret kept from everyone~!?  \n  \n* Includes three other stories:  \n  \n- Kaze ni Hana ni Kimi ni -  \nErika meets Ryousuke, a boy from Tokyo that had a strong passion of swimming until he injured his shoulder, forcing him to abstain from swimming.

Erika wants to help him…  \n- Intercross  \n  \n- Monochrome World -  \nEver since a certain Christmas Day when she was little, Jun has seen the world as Black and White. Even after ten years, her eyes are still like that. She doesn't want to tell anyone about her secret because she's already been \"betrayed\" once by a friend. After that, they were separated. Little did she know of the suprises in store for her…  \n  \n- Alice\n"
