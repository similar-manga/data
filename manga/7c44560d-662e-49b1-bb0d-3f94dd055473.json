Her underclassman Shimanuki isn't going to give up on her just yet, either.  \n  \n3) Sweetheart  \nTomohiro breaks up with Kana, and she thinks she's okay, thinking that she could easily replace her feelings for him; but after deciding to act like nothing happened between them for a while, he comes back the next day and wants to walk home together, and they become just friends.  \n  \n4) I Just Want You to Be With Me  \nStory involves a girl named Mami who initially believes that her relationship with her longtime boyfriend has gotten boring. To make matters worse, this cute guy at her workplace kissed her out of the blue one afternoon, which got her questioning her \"love\" for her boyfriend even more.
