   "en": "An anthology of three Tezuka oneshots from the late 1960's.   \n  \n- **The Runaway Tanker** - Newscaster Goro Tsukinashi is invited to board the world's first atomic-powered, computer-operated oil tanker, the Osakabe Maru. While on its maiden voyage, everything that could go wrong, does go wrong. Can the passengers survive aboard this voyage of the damned?   \n  \n- **Land of the Tigermen** - Television director Goro Ibukuro makes his living exploiting the talents of others on his most popular show, World's Cruelest Acts. After hearing about a tribe of \"Tigermen\" that live in the hinterlands of Borneo that apparently have a miracle cure in the form of a ceremony, he decides to set off and film them. However, he might have taken on more than he bargained for…  \n  \n- **The Spaceman's Base** - Set during the Occupation of Tripoli during World War II, two American soldiers and a German soldier are held hostage by a Japanese boy who hijacks the Americans' Jeep. The boy's destination is the mysterious ruins of Wadan-Wadan, located in the middle of nowhere. What is the connection between the boy and these ruins?\n\n---\n**Volume 66 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
