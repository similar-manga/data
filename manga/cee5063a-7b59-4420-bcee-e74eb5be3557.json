   "en": "Sol doesn't look like anyone else around her. She doesn't remember anything from when she was a kid and has no idea how different she actually is... She only knows that she belongs to the servants of the wealthy country villa where she grows up. Even so, the lord's son, Arel, and his classmate, Eno, are her best friends. When she suddenly finds out where she's actually coming from, her whole world collapses. And Arel and Eno have a difficult decision to make: Should they follow their families' expectations, or should they help their friend? Together they are forced on a long journey all the way to the north of the kingdom. At the same time, they learn about the betrayal and belligerent plans of the adults, but also Sol's unknown, magical powers. Now they know that peace in the kingdom is under threat! Will Sol's power be enough and how will the children succeed in preventing a new war from breaking out?"
