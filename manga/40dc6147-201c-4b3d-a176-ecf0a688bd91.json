   "en": "“Hey! Nagashima-kun!!”\nNagashima-kun, the clumsy baseball boy, is doing a great job!?\nA complete collection of humorous episodes!\nStarting from December 2008, all 5 volumes will be published, one volume each month!\n\nCommentary\nShigeo Nagashima, who transferred to Hitachi Elementary School, is a slightly clumsy and nonsensical boy. A big fan of Shigeo Nagashima, he joins the baseball club as a substitute player after much effort.\nThis work \"Nagashima-kun'' is a representative work of Wachisanpei, who has created many comedy works. Due to the great success and popularity of Giants player Shigeo Nagashima (currently honorary lifetime manager), serialization began in the magazine Shonen in 1959 (Nagashima's second year as a professional). The main character is Nagashima-kun, who is not good at studying but loves baseball, and the story depicts his daily life with his family and teammates, including his father who runs the Tiger barber shop, his kind mother, and his mischievous younger sister Michiko. You will feel a heartwarming warmth in the peaceful interactions between the characters. This book version includes all episodes and will be delivered to readers as a [complete version]. In addition, we plan to publish all five volumes, one volume each month, starting in December 2008.\nI hope you look forward to Nagashima-kun's fun baseball manga."
