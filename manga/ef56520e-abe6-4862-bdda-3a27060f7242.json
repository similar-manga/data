   "en": "*A work that was not collected in the Tezuka 400 released in 1978 due to Tezuka losing the originals, but collected in the Tezuka bunko.*\n\nPinocchio, a marionette created by Mr. Geppetto, is given life by a blue fairy and is able to move freely. If he becomes brave, honest, and kind, he can become human, but the innocent Pinocchio is tricked and sold to a puppet hut or taken to a dreamland where lazy children are turned into donkeys. Can Pinocchio become human?　\n\nThis is an original work done by Osamu Tezuka with all his heart. This is a fantastic work, which is said to have served as the motif for Atom. \n\nFirst published June 1, 1952."
