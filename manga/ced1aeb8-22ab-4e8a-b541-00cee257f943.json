   "en": "Hokuto and Minami transform with \u003cUltra Touch\u003e! !\nDirector Shinji Higuchi also praises! \"Phantom\" Mamoru Uchiyama's version of Ultraman, the first full-scale book = 2nd! !\n\nUltraman, an immortal hero born in Japan. Mamoru Uchiyama's version of 'Ultraman' comics ('Kaeriman', 'A', 'Taro' and 'Leo'), which were serialized in the school year magazine 'Second grade elementary school' from 1971 to 1974, have been published in the 45th anniversary of Tsuburaya Productions Ultraman series. \u003e to commemorate the first full-fledged book release this fall! The second installment is the popular work \"Ultraman A (Ace)\" (1972)!\n\nHokuto Seiji and Minami Yuko, a popular work that was very popular for the series' first \"man and woman combined transformation\" by \u003cUltra Touch\u003e. Its smart and elegant character design, speedy development, and powerful dynamic battle scenes are truly unique to Mamoru Uchiyama's version. On that day, Ultraman A's great success that the boys were heartbroken... is coming back after 39 years!\nThe series, which was praised as \"one of the best masterpieces\" among the many Ultraman comicalized works, was only released as a convenience store comic in the mid-2000s after being published in a magazine (already sold out), and is now difficult to obtain. It became a rare work of \"phantom\", and it was eagerly desired to be published in a cohesive form.\nDirector Shinji Higuchi is also enthusiastic! (=Recommendation comments below) The same work that is very popular even in our own \"reprint request\". This is your chance to collect the 4 great masterpieces with a clear handwriting in an affordable form.\nIn addition to recording all the episodes of the monthly magazine series, including all the cover art from the magazine serialization, a new interview with Mamoru Uchiyama full of secret stories, and a mini comic \"Time Slip Graffiti Boku no Ultra 1972\" drawn by Mamoru Uchiyama are also included. Recording. Stay tuned! !\n\n-Recorded episodes ([Shogaku 2nd grade] May 1972 issue to March 1973 issue): [Shining! Ultra 5 brothers] [Follow the mystery of the transformation super beast!] Ultra 5 Brothers\" \"Return the Pigeon!\" The final counterattack of the super beast!\" Thank you for your understanding.\n\nPublication: Fukkan.com/Planning Cooperation: Shogakukan (C) Tsuburaya Production"
