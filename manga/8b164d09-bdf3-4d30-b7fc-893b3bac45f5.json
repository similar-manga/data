    "en": "For Fujimiya who is a very competent guy at the company, Yuuki, a grandson of the Chairman of the Board has been his longtime rival. Yuuki bears away all girls around Fujimiya, so Fujimiya has been \"unskilled at love\" yet. Yuuki asks Fujimiya to take care of his \"pride and joy\", Shuuta Takahashi during Yuuki's overseas business trip of half-year. Shuuta was a playmate of Yuuki and has no experience of working at office but is very eager to become an accomplished office worker to help Yuuki. Fujimiya is moved by Shuuta's enthusiasm and teaches Shuuta personal computer after his working. Fujimiya can not help loving Shuuta when he drinks too much at the party and is looked after tenderly by Shuuta. But when Yuuki returns he is not all that happy with how the things evolved between Fujimiya and Shuuta...\r\n\r\nAlso includes a short story with the junior high school students Tamura and Mikami from Love Trivia before they become quiz game partners."
