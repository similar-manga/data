   "en": "*A work of two parts: the second never finished due to the magazine suspending publication.*\n\n**Part 1 (Vol 1-3)**: **\"Long, long ago, humans lived almost the same as beasts… If you got hungry, you could just find something to kill and eat it. If someone attacked you, kill them too. Everything was kill to survive, kill to survive. Then people started acting smart and making laws. The laws kept them from doing pretty much everything they wanted to do. Beasts, on the other hand, still have no laws, or etiquette. I predict the day will come when an almost mutant breed of humans will appear, sinking to the level of beasts for freedom… Here, I will call them *Vampires…*\"**\n\nA young boy, Toppei, visits Osamu Tezuka at his anime studio, Mushi Pro, one morning imploring Tezuka to hire him. Tezuka hires Toppei, who makes himself an active part of the team, but as time goes on, the Mushi Pro staff begin to pick up on Toppei's bizarre tendencies...\n\n**Part 2 (Vol 4)**: A certain fellow has made it out of the events of Part 1, now set on using a newly introduced species, the Weko, to attain domination. The Weko, the natural foil to the Vampires, are a dying species. Past and present are interweaved, explaining the history and sightings of the Weko, as one of them finds himself wrapped up in that man's scheme...\n\nTezuka's parody of Shakespeare's Macbeth. \n\n---\n**Volumes 142-144, 320 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
