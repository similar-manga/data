   "en": "Sugai-kun isn't particularly bullied, but he's an elementary school student who is always comfortable in the corner of the classroom.\n　But Sugai-kun has a special secret. That is, he is best friends with Ketsu-chan, a mysterious creature that other people cannot see.\n　Every day is a lot of fun, being able to get along with the \"Alien Ashinoura\" and the naughty \"Kasabuta-kun\"! Because they're always with me, playing with me, and helping me out when I'm in a pinch.\n　Maybe you also have your own \"Ketsu-chan\"! ?\n\nMy father looks like a bird and my mother looks like a cow. One day, he became friends with a mysterious creature called \"Ketsu-chan\" who appeared from a gap in the distorted air.\n　Most people say they can't see Ketsu-chan, but that doesn't matter. I play games and baseball with Ketsu-chan. Ketsu-chan is really my best friend!"
