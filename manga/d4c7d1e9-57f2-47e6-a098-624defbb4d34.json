   "en": "Shota, a man in his late 20s, works at a nursery school, and he tries his best to make the children laugh and smile. However, the children seem to have a hard time paying attention to his comedic storytelling. One night, he goes to a storytelling theater and ends up getting some useful advice from a woman who performed in the show. Afterward, he re-tells his comedic story in a way that is extremely well accepted by the laughing children, and he decides that performance storytelling is what he wanted to do with his life. Soon he begins to take steps to make this dream a reality.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)"
