   "en": "A single sculpture sent from a father who went missing during an African expedition to the boy, Hibiki Shingo, who attends the Rhythm School of Music. The sculpture integrated with the drum was the statue of King Bomba, one of the guardian deities of the Kibara civilization that was destroyed 7000 years ago. By striking the drum of King Bomber, the soul of Makoto is united with King Bomber. King Bomba fights against the demons of the Oudou magic group who are trying to destroy the present human race that has polluted the earth."
