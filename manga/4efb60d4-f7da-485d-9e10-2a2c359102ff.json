   "en": "Ever since he was born, Tatsumi Kodama has possessed blue eyes, a familial trait that grants them supernatural abilities. Whenever he meets gazes with someone, he can see every thought that person has ever thought. But forced to live on an isolated island with other blue-eyed family members, this power has only proved itself a curse. His childhood friend is Kei Arima, the adopted son of a family who looks after the secluded members of the Kodama family.\n\nTatsumi is well-aware of Kei's romantic interest in him, but he refuses to acknowledge his feelings. The burden of bearing blue eyes is insurmountable, and as Tatsumi slowly distances himself from Kei, their bond grows fractured. Will Tatsumi ever be able to meet Kei's gaze?"
