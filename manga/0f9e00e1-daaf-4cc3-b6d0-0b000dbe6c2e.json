    "en": "According to tradition, witches are supposed to be wed to demons as wives; the more magical power contained by the witches, the higher they are sought after by the demon races for prestige, power, bloodline, and fame. 16 year-old Sunya Velladonna decided to break this forced marriage herself, forced onto her by the demon world, and decided to escape to the human realm - only to end up as a runaway bride. While in the human realm, she encountered a recently divorced young doctor, Othder Hurvenss. In order not to be caught and sent back to demon realm, Sunya took the opportunity to make a magic marriage contract with Dr. Othder while he was sleeping. One of them is an escapee from a forced marriage, while the other is one who fell out of love, a disillusioned doctor. With both of them facing marital difficulties and having coincidentally met each other, what will happen to this pair?"
