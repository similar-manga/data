   "en": "Yuko Kusaka is a Japanese journalist sent to Brazil to do a report on the gold rush phenomenon that seems to be making many people rich from night to day.   \n  \nRumors say that among the many \"garimpeiros\" (gold diggers) currently on the Amazon forest, there is a Japanese known as Rio Baraki. Reaching their destination, her crew member is promptly attacked and she is raped as a warning to stop their work and return immediately to their home country. Determined to do her job, she stays and finds out from the attacker that he is none other than Baraki, a white haired muscular man with a large scar on his back. Later she discovers that his real name is Keisuke Ibaraki. Once a promising quarterback, he ended up falsely incriminated by a powerful organization known as GPX."

     "en": "Associated Names: IKEGAMI Ryouichi, อิเคงามิ เรียวอิจิ, 池上辽一, 池上遼一\n\nBirth Place: Fukui-ken, Takefu, Japan\nBirth Date: May 29, 1944\nZodiac: Gemini \n\nIkegami began drawing his first comic series at the age of seventeen. Even then, Ikegami had the magic touch, and his first two collaborative efforts - I UEO Boy with [Koike Kazuo](https://mangadex.org/author/785c1506-618e-4829-9533-86995c04c0a4/koike-kazuo) in 1973 and Otoko Gumi in 1974 with [Kariya Tetsu](https://mangadex.org/author/4279ea10-bc91-47f9-b7a7-aca12bc4430f/kariya-tetsu) - proved so popular they set the pattern for what would turn out to be one of the manga world's biggest success stories. Although many of his earlier works were written and drawn solo, nowadays Ikegami works almost exclusively with collaborators and shows no signs of stopping.\n\nHe worked at [Mizuki Production/Mizuki Shigeru](https://mangadex.org/author/9a7709d7-c9a6-4afb-bdf9-054aec977140/mizuki-shigeru) as an assistant for about a year and a half. He is a fan of [TSUGE Yoshiharu’s](https://mangadex.org/author/0495ec83-5f94-4b89-af30-5db3238581f1/tsuge-yoshiharu) works, Ikegami was surprised when he saw Tsuge also worked at MIZUKI Shigeru’s place.\n\nIkegami once applied to be an assistant to [SATO Masaaki](https://mangadex.org/author/ec701ae7-65a4-4fcc-884c-bee29d3baaac/satou-masaki) \u0026 [SAITO Takao](https://mangadex.org/author/bc302292-841c-42b1-962d-bcb41d427ae2/saito-takao) but they already had enough assistants at that time.\n\n[FUJIWARA Yoshihide](https://mangadex.org/author/d4bd7c05-4986-424a-99d1-30d7d56daa95/fujiwara-yoshihide), [Akiha @](https://mangadex.org/author/4a3fbf8e-d386-400b-b167-7eb729c44e3d/akiha), MATSUHISA Yuu, and SATA Misaki were once his assistants.\n\nSource: [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/authors.html?id=930)"
