After his initial success in the Comic Open contest, he began touring France in 1986, an event that became a significant point in his career. The manga he produced covers a variety of topics, from sports to family comedies to science fiction epics.\n\nIn 1993, he began work on the [Tekkonkinkreet](https://mangadex.org/title/7661932f-7f80-4c3a-bb37-6861a1477876/tekkon-kinkreet) manga, which became a success in the Big Spirits magazine, and published a series of short stories in a collection called Nihon no Kyodai that was publicized at the time by Comic Aré magazine.
