Each segment of the story also has some information about a different planet in the Solar System.\n\nPart 2 (4 chapters)\nThe second half is remarkable in that it is Jungle Taitei ジャングル大帝, simplified and re-written for 3rd grade students. This was a tie-in manga for the then ongoing anime in 1966. As a little lion cub in the jungle, Leo must find a way to stop an aggressive red rhinoceros from hurting his jungle friends. A boxing match between Leo and a rogue lion, Bubu breaks out. Leo saves a brave hero as he gets revenge on Lubar, an elderly leopard. Finally, Laman, Laiya's long-lost brother tells a story about how a hydra-snake was able to devour their entire family.\n\n---\n**Volume 315 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
