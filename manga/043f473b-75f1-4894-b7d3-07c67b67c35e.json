   "en": "\"Don't you want to thank your savior?\" He's teasing me on my sensitive spots... I hate this guy, but I'm still feeling it! Following the clues of a big scoop, a weekly magazine reporter, Mio, went abroad for coverage by ship. When she came to her senses, she had landed on an uninhabited island... A shipwreck!? The person who saved Mio was Takato Masahiro, the missing son of a conglomerate. When she thought, \"I'll get the scoop of my dreams,\" Takato pushed her down. \"You and I are the only two people on this island. You understand the situation, right?\" He licked her nipples with his hot tongue. It's useless, I can't hold my moans...!"
