   "en": "Definitely straight Taki and openly gay Goh are an expert team of \"snatchers\" hired by the police to steal from the mafia. Lately, Goh has been more interested in acquiring Taki than in the usual caches of arms and drugs. Will Taki and Goh become a new kind of partners?  \n  \nYellow Volume 2 marks the return of our heroes Goh and Taki to infiltrate the Japanese narcotics trade. This time, they're after your garden variety heroin that's being floated to Japan in a most unique way. Bullets will fly and Goh and Taki - preoccupied with their budding relationship and the reappearance of past flames - may not be able to avoid the crossfire!  \n  \nIn volume 3, Goh and Taki work as underground drugs and arms snatchers! Their fate begins to twist when people that claim to be Taki's foster parents show up. As Taki's mysterious past becomes unraveled, the two become exceedingly closer.  \n  \nThe curtains for the shocking final stage are drawn in volume 4. Just when their love for each other was finally realized, Gou and Taki's relationship is torn apart by the killer Sandfish. It's now time to come to terms with Taki's dark past… This title includes a newly drawn honeymoon episode you can only see here.",
