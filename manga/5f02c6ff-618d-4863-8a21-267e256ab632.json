   "en": "Nagai's ecchi parody of Mikiya Mochizuki's [Wild 7](https://mangadex.org/title/b5e3ba0f-f735-4a32-a617-2bd3db500091/wild-7?tab=chapters)\n\n(from ebookjapan):\n\nThe Seven Soldier Family is the world's most powerful mercenary family. We call them the \"Mild 7\"!  Wherever they go, they have no enemies. Where the Mild 7 goes, Mild 7 kills everyone who stands in their way! Led by hippie dad Draemon, 36 years old, the Mild 7 make use of machine guns, missiles, rockets, tanks, fighter planes, and even a submarine battleship, the Yamato, which was converted from the sunken Yamato, in their basement. \n\nThis is Go Nagai's quintessential masterpiece, a messily erotic and violent work!"
