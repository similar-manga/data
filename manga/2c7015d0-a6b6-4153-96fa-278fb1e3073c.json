   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\n\nPolly Brown, who has no self-confidence in her own appearance, has spent her life as an even more timid college girl because of a broken heart when she was 16 years old. \n\nThen Kilmenyi approached Polly for some advice. She asked Polly to substitute for her fiancé, Bert, during her own trip because she and Polly have a very similar speaking voice. \n\nBert has lost his sight in an accident, so he doesn't even recognize the understudy.... Soon Polly and Bert's strange days begin... \n\nIn addition to \"The Sound of Snow,\" in which an unexpected turn of events unfolds, \"A Snowy Day\" is also included."
