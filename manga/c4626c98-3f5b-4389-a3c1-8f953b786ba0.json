   "en": "Toki's had it rough. His parents are out of the picture, and he's ready to give up his education in order to get a job and take care of his sick grandma. When his school intervenes to help him out, he winds up living with the quirky substitute art teacher Itsuya and a mysterious girl named Kon. Itsuya also happens to have a little magic, and she uses it to help out those who cross her path — including the young pair boarding with her."
