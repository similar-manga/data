   "en": "Nami Shinjou is a responsible teacher and is a girl anyone can fall in love for : caring, responsible and sweet. She is supposed to enter the best years of her life, living life as society has stated and marrying her now rich childhood friend…. However, Nami's heart dreams with the idea of someone \"sweeping her off\", someone that can bring excitement to her life…. Will this brave \u0026 ideal man ever come? Even if he is a student? Her true dreams will be set in motion when she confiscates a 'ero' magazine from one of the class most handsome students, along with some other embarrassing encounters between the two.  \n  \nNotes : This is perhaps Fuuga's most extensive work in the 'cameo' department. For example, a regular memeber of the cast is Morisaki Midori (one of the mains character of Mako), acting as a Senpai in both work \u0026 love to Nami. Much to his bargain, her steady boyfriend \"the poor\" Sakai-kun gets dragged into some action as well.   \n  \nList:  \n- Morisaki Midori (Mako)  \n- Sakai Ken (Mako)  \n- Kurosaki Rika (Miwaku no Tobira mainly, and just about everything else)  \n- Naitou Asami (Miwaku no Tobira)  \n- Kurosaki Kana (Yuuwaku no Tobira)  \n- Kurosaki Ayu (Yuuwaku no Tobira)  \n- Kubo Satsuki (Yuuwaku no Tobira)  \n- Naitou Takumi (Yuuwaku no Tobira)"
