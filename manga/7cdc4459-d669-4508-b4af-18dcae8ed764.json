   "en": "Shochikubai Miroku is the son of a police commissioner (father) and a traveller (mother). Miroku has lots of connections and is a very good fighter. His main interest is his motorcycle. Kikumasamune Seishiro is the rich son of a large hospital's head doctor. He also fights as well as Miroku. He is a good fighter with smart moves.   \nBido Granmarie is the son of a Swedish ambassador. He's also a playboy, dating many girls at once: can't see himself going steady because he thinks the world can't handle it.   \n  \nKenbishi Yuri is the rich daughter of a world-renowned president of the Kenbishi Business. She loves to indulge on eating. She's also a good fighter, but can never beat Seishiro.   \nHakushika Noriko's parents are a famous japanese painter (father) and a traditional tea ceremony mother. Her only hate is men and can get very violent when they touch her.   \nKizakura Karen lives with her mother, a rich jewel dealer. Her dream is to marry into a rich family using her attractive body and style.   \n  \nTogether, they formed the Yukan Club, solving mysteries to pass time.  \n  \n---\n- **Won the Kodansha Manga Award for Shojo in 1986**"
