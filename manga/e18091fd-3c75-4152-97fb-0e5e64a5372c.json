   "en": "1-3: Imperfect Love Spell  \nFirst year Ueda isn't interested in joining any of the clubs until Momotani Yuushi, crybaby vice-president of the supernatural club, runs into him. Unable to leave his pathetic and adorable senpai alone, Ueda finds himself drawn into the increasingly odd life of the supernatural club.  \n  \n4: Yowareru Karada  \nA swimming lesson reveals ulterior motives between a senpai and his cute kouhai.  \n  \n5: Doukashite Iru!  \nManager Muroi is regarded as attractive, clumsy and hopeless as marriage material by the girls in the office. Good thing there's the adorable and sincere Ogawa and the stoic Taki to take his mind off his hopeless love life.  \n  \n6: Power Of Pants  \nComputer geek and general otaku Takahashi considers himself undersized, but he only has porn to compare himself to. Takahashi's recently struck up an unlikely friendship with jock Miyamoto. Maybe this could be his chance to compare sizes…  \n  \n7: You're Still Standing In The Same Place, Looking At The Same Sky  \nSou always admired Ryu-senpai from the aeronautics club and his close relationship with Komori-senpai. Two years later, Sou runs into them and finds out that Komori is getting married. Can he replace Komori in Ryu's heart?"
