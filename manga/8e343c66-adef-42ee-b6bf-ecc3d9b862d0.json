   "en": "The Iyahaya family, one of Japan's most prominent conglomerates based in Iyahate Prefecture, has decided to take care of a relative named Nantomo while his parents are transferred overseas. Iyahaya Sayoko can't help but be curious about her relative's boy of the same age. What kind of boy is this eccentric Nantomo?\n\nIn the meantime, a boy in a tattered coat appears before Sayoko's eyes, a poorly dressed eccentric person who eats his dog's food. When she asked him what his name was, he said, \"Iyahaya Nantomo (Oh no... I don't know...)\", how unclear. Sayoko and her grandmother hurriedly invited him into their house, convinced that he was their relative, Nantomo.\n\nEven though he is not Nantomo, the head of the Iyahaya family, Totetsumo, decides to keep the poor, mysterious boy as a Nantomo and sends him to Kenkin Academy, the same school as Sayoko.\n\nThe school is in the state of Cold War with The Hatesate family conglomerate and Iyahaya Family conglomerate. With the arrival of Nantomo, the school is dragged into a great explosion of madness."

     "en": "Thanks to the success of Harenchi Gakuen, Dynamic Productions (ダイナミックプロダクション, also known as Dynamic Production or Dynamic Pro, ダイナミックプロ), was founded by Go Nagai with his brothers in April 1969. Meant to be a group to help him with his works, as a consequence Harenchi Gakuen, where he derived almost no royalties from the TV series, films, or related merchandise, Dynamic Productions became a company established to manage Nagai's relations and contractual rights of his work. Dynamic became one of the first companies to require publishers sign contracts (even today many manga are created and published only on the basis of verbal agreements).\n\n(Source: Wiki)"
