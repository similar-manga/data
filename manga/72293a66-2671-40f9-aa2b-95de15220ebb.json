   "en": "Takeshi Kuri, a juvenile delinquent, has a talent for baseball, but smokes cigarettes, has brown hair, and hits people when he gets mad. By the time he was in junior high school, he had played on six different teams, four of which were suspended and two of which were disbanded. He was often ejected from games early on, or had to forfeit games, and was regarded as a useless pitcher by those involved. After being rejected by a number of prestigious schools, he was given one last chance at Yumenoshima High School. During the interview, he hit the manager, Kudo, but somehow managed to pass on one condition. The condition was that he would live with the coach at his house. Kudo is a man who once worked as a coach at the prestigious Toyo. On the first day of school, Kuri took the field in a red and white match. However, he is harassed by the head of the department, who values discipline and common sense. Hisato overcame many hardships and went on a rampage at the South Tokyo Tournament and Koshien. The insane baseball team creates a whirlwind nationwide."
