Togashi has authored numerous manga series in different genres during the past three decades. He is perhaps best known for writing and illustrating the YuYu Hakusho and Hunter × Hunter series, both of which have been published in the popular Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine. Togashi is married to [Naoko Takeuchi](https://mangadex.org/author/40e66f64-a9d2-4fb3-9dc4-9e9a68e9eb9c/takeuchi-naoko), the author of Sailor Moon.\n\nOn December 24, 1997, he co wrote a book with Naoko. He drew Naoko 's work *Sailor Moon*. Naoko also drew some things that are impossible to draw normally, and there are their lip prints in the book. The note is “the Christmas gift of ‘Prince Yoshihiro’ and ’Princess Naoko’”\n\nHe has two children. At the end of December 2012, The message \"my daughter is so cute\" was left in *JUMP FESTA*. \n\nHe is famous for his free imagination, story plot and complex and plump characterization.
