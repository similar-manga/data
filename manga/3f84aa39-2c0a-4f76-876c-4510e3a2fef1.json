She's too cute, and he wants a sexy girl… but it would seem Hinano's mailman disagrees. By day, he hand delivers her mail, and by night he lets down his bleached blonde hair, and… (!!!)–but guys like that aren't Hinano's type!  \n  \n4) Princess Hungry  \nAoi, age 17, has a problem–an abnormal appetite! It's getting hard to keep it a secret from her classmates, but she can't let them know. She still remembers when she started dating her crush Kousaka… and then when he caught her pigging out after they'd parted one night, he never spoke to her again. But now Aoi is going on a trip with some classmates and their friends… and Kousaka is with them!? Is he mad at Aoi? Will he tell everyone her secret?"
