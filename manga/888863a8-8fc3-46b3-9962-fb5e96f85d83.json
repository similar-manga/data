   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nThe Kusakabe Police Department's Documentation Division is also known as the \"Labyrinth Division. Chief Kanzaburo Torii, commonly known as \"Omiya-san,\" takes supreme pleasure in finding \"lost rings\" in cold case files that the detectives in charge have never noticed. The chief's daughter, Yoko Nanao, a new policewoman, has been assigned to the archives section. Although Yoko is placed in a safe department out of parental love, she is not happy with her new job as a detective...? The work was also the basis for a TV drama starring Ken Ogata and Tsunehiko Watase."

In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category.
