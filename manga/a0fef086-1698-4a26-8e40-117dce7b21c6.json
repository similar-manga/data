   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\n\nA Lion Girl's Life in Japan Begins! \n\nA young girl who was raised by lions on the African prairie was taken into the custody of zoologist Dr. Yagami after the death of her parent lion. Named \"Persia,\" she is sent to live with Dr. Yagami, and She then began living with the doctor's twin sons at the doctor's family home in Japan... \n\nPersia is not used to this new life. \n\nThis is the first volume of the hilarious wild girl slapstick manga!\n\n-Addendum on the Anime Adaptation:\n\nPersia's anime adaptation was the second in Pierrot's Magical Girl series after Creamy Mami, and the only one to be an adaptation. The title was altered from *\"I Love Persia!\"* to  *\"Persia, the Magic Fairy\"* (Maho no Yousei Persia, 魔法の妖精 ペルシャ)\n\nBarring Persia's design, which was adapted very closely, and elements of the content from the early chapters being adapted, there is little resemblance to the manga in terms of story, characterization, themes and so forth. \n\nPersia herself in the original manga attempts to adjust to the new environment she finds herself in, connecting with her new family, and moving on from her old habits, which serves as the purpose for both the gags and the dramatic elements in the narrative. It can be said the Persia manga served as a potential influence for works like Kiyohiko Azuma's [Yotsuba\u0026!](https://mangadex.org/title/58be6aa6-06cb-4ca5-bd20-f1392ce451fb/yotsuba).\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Persia is made to be a magical girl, and is granted her abilities before she arrives in Japan. Her outfit from the manga is her appearance after she transforms. She is tasked with gathering Love Energy to sustain the Lovely Dream realm. \n\nWhile dramatic moments surrounding Persia, and her family and friends are present in the anime adaptation as well, they are deliberations by Studio Pierrot and not based on any of the manga's content. \n\nIn fact, many of the anime adaptations dramatic moments might draw more parallels with moments seen in Pierrot's preceding Creamy Mami.\n\nWhile the manga has neither been scanlated nor officially translated, the anime adaptation can be viewed on the streaming service RetroCrush, seen [here](https://www.retrocrush.tv/series/027533s/persia%2C-the-magic-fairy)"
