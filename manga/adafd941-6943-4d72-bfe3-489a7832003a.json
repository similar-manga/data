   "en": "A village shrouded in the sounds of a pipe-organ. Nothing has threatened their peaceful rest, until now…  \nIn the night, the notes of the pipe-organ, blended with the whispers of the wind that enveloped the city, can be heard.  \nRising and falling, [or, the highs and the lows], twittering and bellowing, the beautiful chords.  \nIn the workshop by the entrance of the road to the village the old man is tuning the pipe-organ. The notes of a melody that beckon us toward a peaceful night: a lullaby for the village.  \nBut the children did not share this sentiment. To them, those notes were the voice of the king of the wind. The sonorous battle cry that would play when the king of the wind fought. The one who protected this village. The King of the Wind."

     "en": "Alternative Names: KITOU Mohiro, 鬼頭莫宏 , Mohiro Kitoh \nBirth Place: Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan\nZodiac: Leo \n\nHe was born in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. Started drawing manga when he was in elementary school, and was influenced by OZAWA Satoru, MATSUMOTO Leiji and KAIZUKA Hiroshi. He graduated from Nagoya Institute of Technology. He released several hentai works on COMIC Penguin Club while working at a local automobile manufacturer. He went to Tokyo and became an assistant to KIKUCHI Shouta. Kitoh created the manga Shadow Star and Bokurano, both of which were adapted into anime series.\n\nKitoh's art and writing approaches are unique, with an instantly identifiable visual style and storylines that almost always lean towards the tragic spectrum and focus primarily on the vulnerability and cruelty of human beings. A recurring element throughout his works are graphic depictions of violence and sex involving children. However, his work is not categorized as lolicon and shotacon.\n\nCharacters he draws are almost always tall, skinny, and gangly for their ages and genders. His females, unlike those of most manga series, generally have small breasts and narrow hips. His males are rarely muscular, except under a few circumstances, usually extreme close-ups. Facial features are, usually, small and expressions subtle. Nudity is common in his works. \n\nSource: [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/author/wrffygg/kitoh-mohiro)"
