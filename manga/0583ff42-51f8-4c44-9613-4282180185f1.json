   "en": "Humans were oppressed as \"dummy\" by dinosaurs that evolved into humanoids. The main character of the story, Drag Banryu, was on a wandering journey to avenge his teacher while caring for such humans. Along the way, he defeats all the rogue dinosaurs who were rampaging in the market with his swordsmanship. Then, Tonto, a human boy who was watching this, applied to become Banryu's apprentice. At first, Banryu refuses, but Tonto's enthusiasm allows him to accompany him, and their adventure begins.\n\nThe final episode published in the March 1994 issue of Corocoro Comic was not recorded"
