One day his dreams come to life during the day and Nemo scares Alice, the girl he is in love with. He only wants one thing - to never dream again! He then gets a visit from the dream guard Morpheus who promises him exactly that. With the help of a dream stone, Nemo can lock his nightmares away forever. But that also locks Tedd away and then the stone is also stolen! Can Nemo get his dreams back?"
