In order to relieve the financial burden slightly and achieve independence, she finds a live-in work situation at an old mansion.

But then one day, Futaba discovers the secret of the old mansion… which is–!?   \n  \n2) 17 Romance (17 [Juunana] Romansu) -   \nNatsume, now in high school, was raised like the son her father never had, and so she's determined never to lose out to any man. Homare Misono has been her guy friend for 17 years. Despite their closeness, Natsume always feels the disadvantage her gender places her at. Homare is stronger and better than her at a lot of things. And after saving her from a pervert on the streets, he kisses her…!?  \n  \n3) The Law of Couples (Futari no Housoku) -   \nThe Law of Couples states that all things happen in pairs – including people. Sakiko seems to have found her missing half in Akio, a boy in her same class who always seems to say exactly what she's thinking. But who is she falling in love with? Akio, or the part of herself that she sees in him…?   \n  \n4) Heart Fruit (Haato no Kajitsu) -   \nMeron and her best friend, Chiho, both have a crush on Uchiyama! Meron finds out after she's already told Chiho that she has a crush, so she needs to lie about who she likes in order to protect Chiho's feelings. She chooses… Ryou! The scariest, coldest guy in school, rumored to be an underground ring leader! If anyone will reject her love confession, it'll be him! It works, but then Chiho begins to cry for Meron's sake, and Meron turns to mush… she tells Chiho that she'll try harder to win Ryou's love…!? How deep is she going to dig her grave?? But… for some reason, Ryou really doesn't seem that scary to Meron…"
