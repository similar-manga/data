On his way back from school one night, Ichiro encounters something truly out of this world - a procession of ghosts! A conversation with a reporter in the city reveals that Ichiro is not the only one to have come across paranormal encounters as of late. Then, Ichiro happens to see a girl at the train station, but she, too, has ties to the ghosts...\n\n---\n**Volume 247 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
