    "en": "Hakushaku is the 5-year-old male tortoiseshell cat in residence at the Fujiwara home. He has a tough job trying to keep the two daughters, Shizuka and Yumeko, in line, and he often ends up suffering for his efforts. Shizuka is a high-school-age girl who has stopped going to school and has become a shut-in. Hakushaku tries to encourage her, but sometimes he has to stop her from doing embarrassing things, like showing her boobs on the internet. Yumeko is the younger sister, a middle school girl who has a huge crush on Shizuka. Hakushaku doesn't know how to handle this sister complex! A cat has a hard job in a household with such unusual girls!"
