   "en": "\"The Dead King has been born.\" The imperial harem situated in the empire of Daikou (Da Guang) had launched into an uproar.\n\nInside the coffin of an imperial concubine who was rumored to have been murdered, a baby's corpse was found. On the orders of the empress, Enmei (Yan Ming), a beautiful eunuch, is sent to investigate the corpse to calm the chaos. Enmei then notices Touka (Tao Hua), a maid who remains unperturbed about the presence of revenants and is instead dozing off. Though her features were as lovely as flowers, she possessed no ambitions nor a desire to be promoted; she was an unconcerned and lazy lady-in-waiting. Furthermore, it appeared unlikely that she would bend to Enmei who had at this point ensnared many ladies-in-waiting with his looks. The single thing that would awaken Touka was when a corpse was in front of her. She had knowledge of autopsies. A mystery set in the Chinese imperial harem where the numerous misgivings and mysteries inside the palace will be unraveled one after the other! \n\nsource: https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/nj1wik2/koukyuu-no-kenshi-nyokan"
