   "en": "Futaba is a university student whose house used to be a sumo stable. But it was reopened once again after 10 years of being closed when her father took in the handsome Tsurugaoka as his new disciple.\n\nFutaba's father is the oyakata (master) of the stable, and her days have been spent rejecting her father's demand for her to be the stable's acting okami (matron).\n\nFutaba has her own reasons for hating the sumo wrestling world. To add to that, she came to learn that her father had actually given Tsurugaoka a secret requirement for his acceptance. And that requirement is that Tsurugaoka must marry Futaba!!\n\nThis is a story about love and family with a sumo stable as its stage!!\n\nsource: https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/frf882w/sumai-no-sechie"
