   "en": "Legendary delinquent Ryu disappeared two years ago, but that doesn't deter Hizuru Omoda, who aspires to become his right-hand man. With \"Accept all fights!!\" as his motto, Hizuru terrorizes his fellow students at the library every day. But, the only person he can't beat is the student librarian, Ryusei Hatogaya, who has no mercy for those who disturb the peace on his turf. He's always keeping Hizuru busy with library assistant tasks.  \nOne day, Hizuru overhears the other library assistants demanding that Ryusei kick him out, but surprisingly, Ryusei seems to acknowledges Hizuru's worth. Ever since then, Hizuru's been opening up to Ryusei, but that doesn't stop him from picking a fight with him!This is a story of a hero-worshipping delinquent, a student librarian with a secret, and… a man who claims to be Ryu's old partner…! Packed with serious fistfights and equally intense lovemaking, this is Sakae Matsubara's first yaoi story with a delinquent bottom. All shall cower before his glorious member!!"
