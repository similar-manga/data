   "en": "*A work that was not collected in the Tezuka 400 released in 1978 and a work that remained uncollected for many years. Shogakukan Creative released a collection containing Yajiuma March as well as the serialization versions of The Secret of Piron and Adventure Broadcasting Station.*\n\n(from fukkan.com)\n\nThe first reprint of a fantastic excavated work that no one has ever seen!\n\nThe Shogakukan grade school magazine is also known as a hidden treasure of masterpieces. Osamu Tezuka, who had made his debut in the magazine alongside the great prewar mangaka, poured his extraordinary energy and ideas into the new stage of the magazine---and he was not afraid to show them off. \n\nSince its publication, it has never been collected, and its existence was unknown among fans and researchers alike, with the exception of a few, so you can only read this fantastic gem, \"Yajiuma March\" (93 pages) here!\n\nContents:\nYajiuma March\" Serialized from September 1970-February 1971 issues of \"Second Grader\" (Shogakusei Ninnen).\n\nA very unique slapstick comedy depicting the surrealistic upheaval caused by a human-horse hybrid, Umataro of Yaji's House!"
