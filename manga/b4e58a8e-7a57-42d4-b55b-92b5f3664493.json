   "en": "Bizzare phenomena all over the continent struck fear in the mighty Guelle empire. A sacrifice must be made to appease the heavens. How convenient is it that the royal throne just put out an announcement that they're looking for a tribute bride of noble birth with a hefty sum of money as a reward? Enter Valia Dean, who just overcame her second near-death experience as a destitute orphan. In order to save Karl, the senile mercenary who raised her in her late parents' absence, Valia volunteers to marry Marquess Shuden Gartt, whose reputation for massacre pales in frightfulness to the coldness of his gaze. Valia, hardened by misfortune, orphancy, starvation, and betrayal, accepts what seems to be certain death. Even in marriage, she will not love. It won't matter how handsome, rich, gentle, chivalrous, and caring he is, or how lovingly he behaves as her husband, right?\n\n_\n\nValia was born into a fallen noble family as the daughter of a knight and lived a sad life. Then, the opportunity of a second life comes to her.\n\n‘Should I live like that again?’\n\nNo, she won’t!\n\nValia decides to become a temple princess in order to live a happier life without having to worry about money. But then, as a princess, she becomes the wife of Shuden, the most handsome man and highest-ranking noble in the Empire…!\n\nBut in the future, Shuden falls in love with a new woman from another world. Valia knows this, but she can’t get away from Shuden, who is in love with her!\n\nValia, Shuden’s princess–what is her fate?\n\n“You are the only one in my life that I will love. If I break my oath…I will pay for it with my life.”"
