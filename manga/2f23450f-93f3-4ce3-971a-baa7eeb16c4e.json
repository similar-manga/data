   "en": "Yume no Shiro is a one volume work by Masami Tsuda and consists of 3 short stories, that were drawn while Kare Kano was still running.  \nIt's all about love couples. Also, there is a thread running through all three stories. That's a magician who helps the people. Who are the people he helps?  \n  \n1) Inside the Forest  \nSana loves the forest and is friends with the animals. However she is a noble's daughter that has been recently requested to be a concubine for a king due to the death of his previous concubine. Unwilling, she becomes his concubine, however she seems to have fallen in love, but he only loves his dead wife…  \n  \n2) I'm a Mermaid  \nThe island priestess discovers a golden-hair, blue eyed man that seems to be an enemy. However both fall in love…  \n  \n3) The Castle of Dreams  \nLord Lafense has enough of his life and decided to commit suicide by jumping off the castle wall, but it seems that his faithful servant Chita is dragged along with him. However, when they woke up, they found freedom in a dream-like castle. Are they really in the afterlife as they thought or is it something more..magical?"
