In the same year he got the serialization of this one shot.\n\nAfter some time he published a new one shot Sensei no Barrage in Jump Next!, and in 2012 he got serialization of it. In this year he gained some popularity also worldwide, like in USA and in Europe.\n\nIn 2014 he started Boku no Hero Academia, basing the series on some concepts from an old one-shot, and briefly the series became a very big hit, generating a franchise and winning some national and international prizes.\n\nHe was assistant of TANAKA Yasuki.\n\nMIYOKAWA Masaru, WATANABE Chihiro and SHIBATA Yusaku were his assistants during Oumagadoki Doubutsuen.\nHORIE Ryuu and AKIYAMA Yoco were once his assistant on Hero Academia.\nWhile NEDA Hirofumi and OOTAKE Toshitomo has worked as his assistant on both series.\n\nHe stated that OSADA Yu-Ko is one of his influences, Horikoshi also stated, that Osada’s drawings are the complete form of shounen manga.\n\nHe used to send One Piece fanart, his artwork once included in the Usopp Gallery Pirates of volume 23.\n\nHe started reading American comics after the movie Spider-Man by Sam Raimi came out in 2002.\nHe has a sister.\n\n"
