   "en": "Risako Ashikawa is a career woman who has lived her life solely on the job since breaking up with her boyfriend six years ago. She is highly regarded by those around her as cool and capable in her work. However, as soon as she reached her 35th birthday and became a \"35-year-old single woman,\" her reputation changed drastically. She is now spoken of behind her back, saying, \"To be that old and not be married...there must be something lacking in you as a person.\"\nHowever, even her friends of the same age who seem to be happily married seem to have their own problems with work, with their husbands, childbirth, and child rearing......\nRisako wonders, \"What in the world is a woman's happiness?\" Will she be able to find true happiness for herself?\n\n(google translated)"
