   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\n\nAbused by their aunt, a young sister and brother are locked in a barn on a cold, snowy night when they discover an old photograph of their deceased mother in the barn. At that moment, the barn door opens and a woman who looks exactly like their late mother appears. \n\nThe siblings rejoice that their mother has come from heaven to see them, but she is a single female pickpocket named Oshichi, who is being hunted by the police. But the young siblings' feelings for their mother bring tears to Oshichi's eyes... \n\nIn addition to \" The Snowman Who Watches the Moon\", a fantasy masterpiece by Pearl King, this collection includes her debut work \" The Mountain Witch and the Young Tanuki\", \"Luna's Holiday\", \"Sophie's Puppet Show\", \"Sunflowers in Winter\", and \"The Miracle of Christmas\"."
