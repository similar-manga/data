   "en": "Haru Akaishi's father has just died, leaving him an orphan at age 17. It seems his father was in a lot of debt and took out some shady loans. Just when the Yakuza-esque creditors come to collect, a mysterious lawyer named Yuuji Senoh appears and says he'll deal with the matter personally. As it turns out, Mr. Senoh was someone Haru befriended many years ago as his mother ailed in the hospital, but Haru had forgotten about him. When the bank takes back the mortgage on his house, Haru takes Mr. Senoh up on his offer to live at his apartment. While Mr. Senoh claims that he's only trying to offer financial support to Haru as a minor, perhaps there's is a stronger bond between the two than either realize at first."
