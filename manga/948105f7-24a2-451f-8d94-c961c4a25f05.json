   "en": "A world where everything is decided by baseball. In order to defeat the Beanball that took his father's life, the main character, Vesbol, travels day and night to the \"Baseball Kingdom\" where only top-notch butlers (baseball players) who have reached uniform number 100, where he is said to be, gather. It was a baseball game!\n\nThe baseball game in this work is basically 1vs1 between the pitcher and the batter, and both are played first and second. The uniform number on the back is a point system, and if you win the game, you can freely take away the opponent's points (Basically, you take all the points, but Vesbol sometimes leaves some for the opponent). It can also be used as a substitute for money."
