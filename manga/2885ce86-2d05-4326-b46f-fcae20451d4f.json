   "en": "\"I’m asking you to do me!\" Izuki is an office worker who often gets dumped by his girlfriends because he's too nice. One day, he bumps into Usami who works at the bar he frequents. Seeing Usami drunk and falling asleep on the street, he can't find it in himself to leave him there, so he takes him to his house for lack of a better option. When he finally manages to get home, Usami wakes up and gives him a blowjob. \"Do it with me...\" His incredible skills make Izumi get hard as a rock, while the sensation of his hard-on pressing against Usami's slippery hole makes him involuntarily shake his hips...!! An extremely good-natured, straight office worker and a tough-looking and flashy waiter make a sweet and sensual agreement to start a time-limited relationship."
