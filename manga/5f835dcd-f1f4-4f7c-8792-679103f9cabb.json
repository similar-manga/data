   "en": "When Masachika Ebisu arrives to stay for the first time in a dorm at a remote boarding school in the mountains, his attendant Shibazaki calls on the roommate Wataru Tamon to take care of master Masachika-sama. It's a burden Tamon did not want, but one that he reluctantly embraces even as he realizes he is not acting like himself by doing so. Ebisu is a spoiled cheeky brat, totally inept and a liar, all of which angers and frustrates Tamon to no end. But, there is also a naïve vulnerability to the boy whose only friend up to now has been his servant, Shibazaki. From his fear of thunder that has him crawling into Tamon's bed to his never-ending mentioning of Shibazaki's name, Tamon grows angrier and colder towards the source of his frustration. But, Ebisu wants Tamon to pay attention to him; he wants to get along with his roommate and become best friends. It's so easy for Ebisu to express his feelings freely, unlike Tamon who keeps his growing infatuation for his roommate a secret. But keeping his emotions to himself leads to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. Can the two of them find the courage to tell each other their true feelings before it's too late?"
