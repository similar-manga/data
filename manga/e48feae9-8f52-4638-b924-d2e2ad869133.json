   "en": "A population promotion policy has been implemented to control the population that has grown too much. A 16-year-old or older was considered an adult, and possession of guns and swords was recognized, and duels were legalized! Challenge the duel to those who bully those who are weak in strength and defeat one after another. In the splendid gun judgment, people called him unreliable, The Kid! The story suddenly evolved with the appearance of the Japanese president, Eiko Higashiro. In preparation for the food crisis due to population growth, the government planned a plan to wipe out and destroy humans in the Kyushu area, and requested unreliable oil for its financial cooperation. However, Kid was enraged by the cruel mass murder plan and refused the request of Fire Tiger, so it became a national wanted arrangement. Kid is going to Kyushu to stop the conspiracy, but what he was waiting for … An end-of-the-century western story depicting the near future of humanity."
