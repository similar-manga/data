   "en": "\"I only have manga.\"\n\nIn 1965, still a high school student, Tsurita made her debut as the first newcomer of the newly published Garo. Through her science fiction shorts, she delved into surrealism, capturing the zeitgeist of the 1960s, before later succumbing to the incurable disease SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus). This work contains Tsurita's works from her debut to the last years of her life as well as a detailed chronology of her life, with a \"Kuniko Tsurita Yearbook\" at the end.\n\n(Source: Seirin Kogeisha)\n\nIncluded Stories:\n1.
