She will definitely get a great boyfriend and say her goodbyes to those lonely days!! Kyouka has two brothers who love her a lot. Every guy who comes close to Kyouka is kicked out by them, thus she has no boyfriend. But she finally found an ideal prince… or that's what she thought. This guy, Maki, is actually a perverted prince!?  \n  \n* Also includes two short stories in volume 2:  \n  \n- Nani-sama?! Oresama  \nSatomi loves Yuuya a little too much and is totally wrapped around his little finger. But, if this continues, instead of becoming his girlfriend, she'll forever remain his gofer. Will Satomi do something to find out exactly where she stands with Yuuya?  \n  \n- Ijiwaru wa Kuchibiru  \nDuring Shiori's fifteenth spring, she fell in love with the idol Shuu Kitamura. She was even lucky enough to get to meet him in person, but she realizes he's nothing but a fraud! However, due to certain circumstances, Shiori becomes Shuu's personal assistant!?"
