One of the pioneers of the *gekiga* genre, he was well-known for his social critique and realistic drawing style. He debuted as a mangaka in 1957, and began publishing his first popular and long-running series *Ninja Bugeichou* in 1959. \n\nIn 1964, he helped Katsuchi Nagai found the manga anthology magazine *Garo*; the first story published in the magazine was his series *Kamui*, which is often considered his most important and influential work. Deeply influenced by marxism, the series touches upon the inherent discriminations that can be found in a feudal society and is a denounciation of the treatment of the *burakumin*, a Japanese social minority.\n\n*Kamui* ran until 1971, and was then restarted in 1988 in the magazine *Big Comic*, for which Sanpei had worked in the meantime.\n\nShirato Sanpei passed away on October 8th, 2021 due to aspiration pneumonia. His brother, Okamoto Tetsuji, who had worked with him as his assistant, passed away four days later of interstitial pneumonia."
