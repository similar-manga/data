   "en": "Technology has finally allowed humans to colonize Mars.\n\nPeople from all over the Earth have migrated to Mars and now several generations of human residents have been born and raised on the red planet.\n\nThough, it is not without stipulation.  \n\nDespite such a monumental achievement, humanity's follies emerge to bring about suffering. \n\nMars is lawless, much like the Wild West of old and despite efforts to stabilize, corruption and crime are prevalent.\n\nAn ever present reminder of humanity's cruelty, Martians of what is known as \"The Moro Tribe\" periodically attack and kill any humans they come in contact with as revenge for the genocide committed against their people years ago. \n\nThe Story begins In Hedes Town, where Mamoru(played by Rock Holmes) goes off to meet the child of a family friend Kenn who just arrived from Earth.\n\nDespite the warnings against leaving during a storm, Mamoru heads off stubbornly. On his way, Mamoru gets ambushed by the Moro Tribe before being rescued by a boy calling himself \"Captain Ken\"\n\nKen proclaims himself to be the one Mamoru waited for but heads off before Mamoru could ask him anything. \n\nWhen Mamoru arrives home, he encounters Kenn, who is a *girl*. Confused by this, Mamoru begins to question the nature of Kenn's identity...\n\n[Official English](https://emanga.com/collections/osamu-tezuka/products/captain-ken-vol-1?variant=29427959302)\n\n---\n**Volumes 25 and 26 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
