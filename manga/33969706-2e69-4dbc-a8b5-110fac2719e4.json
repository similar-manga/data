   "en": "*All Digital Editions Currently Delisted as of October 31st 2019*\n\nRobocon is a bright red robot who has left his home, Robotland, to come to the human world without the permission of his teacher. As a service robot made to assist humans, Robocon couldn't resist the urge to start helping humans as soon as possible, longing to see their happy faces. But his teacher, Gants, was completely right in saying that Robocon wasn't ready to go anywhere: Robocon doesn't understand anything about how humans do things, so he screws up the tasks he's given. This is the story of Robodon's struggles, hijinks, and joys as he lives amongst humans and does his best to make them smile.\n\nThis robot comedy manga was released concurrently with a tokusatsu TV broadcast of the same name, and also spawned a hugely popular line of die-cast toys."

Like most of the Japanese artists, Ishimori was influenced by Tezuka Osamu. In 1956, he formed a coterie group with Akatsuka Fujio, Nagashima Shinji and Suzuki Mitsuaki. He moved to Tokyo after graduation, where he continued to work as a mangaka, starting with the war story Kaiketsu Harimao in 1959. Subsequently, he produced hit mangas such as the science fiction series Cyborg 009 (1964) and the historical series Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae (Big Comic, 1968-72). In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category. In 1989, he commenced working on a large series about the history of Japan, Manga Nihon no Rekishi, which remained unfinished due to the artist's death on January 28th, 1998 at the age of 60.\n\nIshinomori was nicknamed the 'King of Manga' and is considered one of the pioneers of modern manga. He was also one of the most productive creators, producing over 120,000 pages of artwork in thirty years. It's rumored that he drew over 500 pages in one month!"
