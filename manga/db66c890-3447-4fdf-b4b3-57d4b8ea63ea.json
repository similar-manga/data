   "en": "Moguro Fukuzou seductively approaches and murmurs to modern people with various worries and desires. However, those who break their promises to him will pay the price and fall into the abyss. This is a masterpiece of black humor in which we are made to taste the foolishness and weakness of human beings.\n\n* *Black Salesman* is an earlier title used for the series. It's a 1 volume release and all its stories were included in *Laughing Salesman* volume 1."

Their real names are Hiroshi Fujimoto (藤本 弘, Fujimoto Hiroshi, 1933–1996) and Motoo Abiko (安孫子 素雄, Abiko Motoo, 1934-2022). They formed their partnership in 1951, and used the Fujiko Fujio name from 1954 until dissolution of the partnership in 1987.\n\nFrom the outset they adopted a collaborative style where both worked simultaneously on the story and artwork, but as they diverged creatively they started releasing individual works under different names, Abiko as Fujiko Fujio Ⓐ (藤子不二雄Ⓐ, Fujiko Fujio Ē, credited as Fujiko A.

Throughout their career they won many individual and collaborative awards, and are best known for creating the popular and long-running series Doraemon, the main character of which is officially recognized as a cultural icon of modern Japan. Some influences of most of their projects are the works of acclaimed manga artist [Osamu Tezuka](https://mangadex.org/author/21575d70-b954-4e3a-80df-00192f413a83) and many US cartoons and comic books—including the works of Hanna-Barbera."
