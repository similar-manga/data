   "en": "Official Indonesian adaptation of Japanese manga [Dragon Zakura](https://mangadex.org/title/fa1679f3-dd5d-4807-b15a-c21ed94d1d51).\n\nDonny Wirianaga is a lowly lawyer who lives in his office house, which is already overdue. In order to survive practicing in Jakarta, he accepts a case to mediate the bankruptcy of Wijaya Kusuma High School, a school that is about to liquidate its assets due to debt.\n\nBut Donny realized that mediating the liquidation of a bankrupt school's assets would not make him a top lawyer in the capital! He was determined to make a breakthrough, by making Wijaya Kusuma High School, which was previously known as a loser school with bratty students, into a top school. A champion school with students who are subscribed to Indonesia's top universities: UI, ITB and UGM!\n\n(Source: MU)"
