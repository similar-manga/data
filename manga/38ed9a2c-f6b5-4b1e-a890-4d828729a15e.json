So, if the sex doesn't work out, I'll cancel this lovers' relationship.\"\n\nSawako is in love with her junior colleague, Ousaka. He doesn't seem interested in going steady with anyone so when she finally mustered up the courage to confess to him and asked him to date her for only 3 months, she was surprised to find him agreeing to it!\n\nLater that night, he took her out on a date and she felt all excited by how dreamy it was but then, she found herself being dragged into a hotel room after that!? He forcefully cornered her, saying that since it'll only be for 3 months, and started to intensely intertwine his tongue with hers as something hot and hard begin to press against her...\n\nOusaka insisted that sex is necessary for them to continue as a real couple and Sawako decided to accept this, however...!?"
