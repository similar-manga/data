Deeply influenced by marxism, the series touches upon the inherent discriminations that can be found in a feudal society and is a denounciation of the treatment of the *burakumin*, a Japanese social minority.\n\n*Kamui* ran until 1971, and was then restarted in 1988 in the magazine *Big Comic*, for which Sanpei had worked in the meantime.\n\nShirato Sanpei passed away on October 8th, 2021 due to aspiration pneumonia.
