   "en": "Akira is an energetic elementary school student who has excellent motor nerves and looks good in very short shorts. She looks like a boy, but she's a good girl. One day, I was able to visit the filming site of a tokusatsu hero with her friend. An accident occurs where the stage set collapses! Akira, who successfully kicked away the debris with a dropkick, was expected by the director to make a special appearance. However, what was presented to Akira who was delighted was a chameleon monster costume made of rubber. Eh, no way...! ? Yes, the so-called \"suit actor\" who put on a costume and acted was my first job. Akira is depressed by the difference from the image. But it's hot, heavy, and extremely hard. Will Akira be able to change her mind and complete her role? Filming for an elementary school actor comedy full of love and dreams has begun!"
