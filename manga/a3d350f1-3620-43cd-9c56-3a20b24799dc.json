   "en": "8 years ago, a chemical terror attack occurred in the open area in front of Mazara Station, Tokyo.\n\nOne of the victims was Magome Rika, who was a university student then. Rika was stuck in a coma for 8 years and it was almost her 28th birthday when she finally woke up.\n\nWhile feeling lost and like she had just time-travelled, she finds herself being unable to open up to her family about her current feelings.\n\nThat's when she met Wada Kazuto, another victim of the attack who had, like her, also just woken up from a coma.\n\nAs the event of the terror attack starts fading from the public's memory, the two, having lost their precious time, teamed up to pursue the truth behind the incident.\n\nsource: https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/b1i8921/re-colorful"
