    "en": "Julie’s family is very poor, and since she’s plain and ugly, as her sister has told her time and time again, she does most of the chores in her house. By accident, she meets the Yee family while trying to get her plane back from a tree in their yard. She meets the family again a year later and is adopted into their family. Soon she becomes a pawn between Mr. Yee’s new wife and his oldest son Ryan, both of which will use Julie as a means to hurt one another. Can Julie survive her new life till she’s of legal age to leave?"
