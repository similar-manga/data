   "en": "Natsume fell in love at first sight with Rui, a very handsome boy she saw near the school gate. That was the first day of the new school term, when she became the second year of her high school. Nearly at the same time she got herself a new friend, Chiyako, a very beautiful transferred student who turned out to be Rui's older sister. For some reason Chiyako was determined to be Natsume's best friend, and naturally there's no way Natsume would refuse Rui's sister–and the easiest method to get to know Rui.  \n  \nNatsume soon learned (mostly from Chiyako) that besides being younger than herself and actually her kouhai, Rui was also a real, professional model, an extremely moody one. He's a spoilt person that often showed a very nasty attitude. To top it all he HATED summer thoroughly and completely. But nothing of these could kill Natsume's love for Rui. How would Natsume, the simple and plain summer girl win Rui's heart? A funny, cheerful and romantic shoujo manga from Yachi Emiko-sensei."
