   "en": "Kantaro Shibata, a petite and lewd father who loves women. On the other hand, his son, Bungo, is a handsome man who hates women and has a habit of getting allergic reactions when women approach him. Kantaro's wife passed away after giving birth to Bungo, so Kantaro raised him single-handedly. The First Investigative Division of the Shimonomachi Police Station, where the Shibata parent and child are, has other unique characters. Kawakami section manager who is her reliable boss and is in the same period as Kantaro. A karate belt holder with sunglasses and a perm. He's a puffy-faced Popeye who always smokes a pipe. Gan, a diligent detective who is extremely weak to Aya, his only daughter. A large body that is not good at water. Misao is the only female police officer who is always touched by Kantaro on her buttocks. These unique detectives work hard to solve everything from small town cases to heinous crimes."
