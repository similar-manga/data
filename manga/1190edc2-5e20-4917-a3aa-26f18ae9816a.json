   "en": "1-5: Stalemate  \nShinichi and his uncle (Chiharu) have always had a close relationship. Meeting almost everyday to play games and have chess matches together all the way through to his high-school years. Both treasure each other and the relationship they have but as time passes and both are unable to say what they really feel or ask for what they really want, they for a time start to drift apart. Until the distance and a \"final\" chess match decides once and for all what they both wanted all along.  \n  \n6: Holding Hands Together  \nShinichi's cousin Sakura Tomo returns after 10 years to his Shinichi's family home in the countryside, where he stayed for some time as a boy. This house contains memories of a past trauma but also of a first love, but is it really how he remembers it?  \n  \n7: Getting Close to a Cat  \nGohongi Kotarou looks like a Bruiser but actually he loves cute little cats, although he doesn't know how to handle them gently. Therefore Nakano offers to teach him, feeling sorry for the fearful cats after having to experience first hand Kotarou's rough attempts at affection."
