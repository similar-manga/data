Itagaki confirmed these reports in a joint interview with her father in the September 2019 issue of Weekly Shonen Champion, stating that she did not wish to disclose her parentage until she was established in the manga industry in order to avoid accusations of nepotism.\n\n\"Paru\" is the pseudonym taken by his father through name divination. Keisuke Itagaki believes that using \"Paru\" can cause a sensation (as for why he chose the word \"Paru\", Keisuke  said he had forgotten).\n\n"
