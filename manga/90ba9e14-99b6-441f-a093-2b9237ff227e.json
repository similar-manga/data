   "en": "The year is 2035 and schools have been suffering from a lack of child birth which has caused many of them to close. An energetic girl named Manami Amamiya transfers to a new school where she quickly becomes the student council president and starts to bring back some vigor in the students lives.  \n  \nGakuen Utopia Manabi Straight! is a Japanese multimedia project co-developed by ufotable and MediaWorks. It originally began as a reader-participation game with its development directly influenced by readers, launching in volume 12 of MediaWorks' Dengeki AniMaga magazine in August 2004. It continued until volume 19 in August 2005, at which time the magazine ceased publication. A manga adaptation with story by ufotable and illustrated by Tartan Check was serialized in MediaWorks' Dengeki Daioh magazine between December 2005 and February 2008. Four tankōbon volumes were released between May 2006 and February 2008. A 12-episode anime produced by ufotable aired between January and March 2007, with an OVA in October of that year."
