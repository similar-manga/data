   "en": "Yoshida, who worked for a black company, died in an accident.  \n  \nDue to a mistake during reincarnation work, he couldn’t be reincarnated in his original world.  \n  \nGod suggested him to reincarnate in a different world with a mischievous angel, who unwillingly accompanied him, as his support; and the two were born into the world of sword and magic as twin brother and sister.  \n  \nA few years later, Yoshida took magic lessons from his angel sister and began his special training so that he could lead a fulfilling life.  \n  \nBut the younger sister, who changed her mind to enjoying this world, was aiming for a parasitic life where she could live comfortably, so she continued training her brother so that she could use him well.  \n  \nBeing an adventurer, or the third generation of inn owners, Yoshida’s second life with a younger sister, who doesn’t wanna work, begins."
