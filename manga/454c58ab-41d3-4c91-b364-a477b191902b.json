   "en": "Hino Maruka had always wanted to be a detective, but she works a police box. She was raised around lots of cats and dogs, and being around them has sharpened her sense of smell to a superhuman ability--she can even smell feelings. One day, she is pulled in to help with a hostage case, and her sense of smell actually ends up helping her to resolve the situation. After this, it looks like her dream of becoming a detective will come true. There are many more cases ahead of her!\n\nsource: mangaupdates\n\n\n**Official release**:\n- Indonesia release by Level Comics as **Police Girl Maruka**"
