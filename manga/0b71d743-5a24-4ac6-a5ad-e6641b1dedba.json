   "en": "1-2: Koi wo Shimashou, Koi wo Kanjite (Let's Make Love)  \nManagement consultant Kobayashi uses his work to pick up younger men who catch his eye. Unfortunately, on his latest project, he finds himself stuck with morose middle-aged manager Chief Araki.

A cheerful security guard enters his life, but even he finds Shingo's violent mood swings too much to handle.  \n  \n6: Tsurete Itte Kure (Take Me With You)  \nShimizu takes care of his former boss Chiba, who is struggling to cope with a marriage breakdown, unemployment and a drinking problem. But are his motives purely altruistic?  \n  \n7: Memorial Day  \nA widowed assistant director is desperate to find a birthday gift for a favorite employee."
