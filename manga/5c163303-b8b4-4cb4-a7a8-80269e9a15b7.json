   "en": "Ibara Nayuki is a figure skater who is active all over the world. However, he has no desire to behave a certain way to appeal to the public, is appalled by the audience and is overwhelmed by his coach. Vassily, a ballet dancer once called a prodigy, appears before him. Two people who are stagnated in their lives meet, and their lives move.\n\n---\nIbara Nayuki is a figure skater competing across the globe. While he has great technical skills, his performances fall apart at competitions and he continues to lose. Spectators are left confused to why he doesn't show any frustration or disappointment. With scathing eyes, a man named Valerie watches Ibara skate and tells him that he is a terrible skater. \"Not knowing why you are on stage is the same as not knowing who you are.” This encounter changes his life forever as a friendship sparks between the two. Read as Ibara, a skater who lacks passion, and Valerie, a once talented ballet dancer, navigate their heartbroken lives."
